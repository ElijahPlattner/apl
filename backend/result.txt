To the King and to His glory

THE END OF THE BEGINNING

Rebellion minus 0 hours

A

swarm of angels passed overhead in the King’s Realm. One
landed near Elric and shouted, “Come quickly! There is
war!”

Elric raised his eyebrows. “What is war?” He turned toward the
Mount of Assembly in the recesses of the north and gasped. Flashes
of fire and lightning lit the heavens. Smoke billowed high.
“It’s Lucifer. He is trying to ascend above the throne of the King
and make himself like the Most High.”
Elric shook his head and scowled. “But that is not possible. He
can’t possibly think—”

“We must go quickly.”
They spread their wings and joined the rush toward the mountain.
Flapping and jostling amid the crowd, the angel called out to
Elric, “His pride has deceived him. Now all light within him is gone.
All reasoning of truth is lost. And worse, he deceived many of our
own to join him in a rebellion. Michael has issued a call for all of us
to join the fight.”
“But I don’t know how to fight,” Elric shouted over the flurry of
the flight.
“We will all learn,” the other angel called back. He tucked his
wings in and dove downward.
Elric hovered above the army advancing up the base of the
mountain. Millions of angels pressed hard against a wall of defenders.
Flashes of fire blasted up the mountain. The deafening roar of battle
rang in his ears. Smoke burned his eyes, and he winced at the rank
burning sulfur.
How is this possible? None of this makes sense. There must be a third
of the heavenly host fighting against the King. Why would they even want
to . . .
A sizzling hum approached from below. Elric glanced down. A
pulsing ball of plasma energy hurtled toward him. He cut hard left,
but the missile plowed into his chest. A shock wave of searing pain
shot through his body. He gasped for a breath. Then everything went
black.
Elric awoke face down on the ground. He shook his head and
blinked.
This is pain. A most unholy sensation I hope never to experience
again.

THE END OF THE BEGINNING

The pain subsided, and his strength returned. He pushed up with
his arms, but a tromping foot on his back smashed him back down
onto his face. He rolled. Another foot pounded down where he had
just been. There, on the left—a rock formation jutting out from the
cliff wall. He rolled again, clawed his way behind a cleft, and pulled his
legs in out of the marching horde. He sat up and examined the faces
of the attackers. Sinister and malevolent expressions twisted their faces.
Their eyes! Red. Evil. Devoid of all light.
A hand gripped his shoulder from behind. He turned with a jolt
and looked up. The eyes? Brown and sparkling with life. The angel
flipped back his long, flowing, jet–black hair and offered Elric his
hand.
“New to the fight?” the angel asked, pulling Elric to his feet.
Elric nodded.
“I am Jenli, minister of records.”
“Elric, choir director.”
“It is a dark day,” Jenli said.
“I don’t understand it,” said Elric.
“Neither do I.”
“What are we supposed to do?”
“The King has already pronounced judgment. The rebels are to
be stripped of four dimensions and removed from the King’s Realm.
They are to be cast down to earth into the Middle and Physical
Realms. He has spoken. But we must cast them down.”
“How do we do that?”
“Simply take hold of them and translate into the Middle Realm.
Once you have them there, let them go and translate back here. They
will not be able to follow. Watch me. This will be my third one.”

Jenli waited and eyed each passing attacker. One passed that
was about his size. Jenli pounced from behind and wrapped his arm
around the rebel’s neck. The rebel squealed. Jenli tightened his grip
and lifted him off the ground. Jenli wrapped his wings around the
two of them and disappeared.
Elric nodded and took a deep breath. He waited. He took
another breath. Waited. I am larger than most of these rebels. Surely,
I will have the strength. He took another deep breath. He pounced.
He caught a rebel in a chokehold and jerked him upward. A surge
of energy coursed through his frame—power from the Throne. He
gritted his teeth, wrapped his wings around his mark, and translated
into the Middle Realm.
In the Middle Realm, the rebel writhed under Elric’s grasp and
screamed. Elric released him and stepped back. The rebel fell in a
heap and twitched and stretched. Elric covered his mouth at the
horrific sight before him. The rebel’s skin had become ashen black, as
though scorched by fire. His hair, what remained of it, shriveled into
sparse wiry tufts. The once–translucent white wings became leathery
and bat-like. The rebel turned his face upward toward Elric, his red
eyes full of hatred, and hissed. Yellow sulfur streamed through his
jagged teeth. Elric turned away, wrapped his wings around himself,
and returned to the King’s Realm.
Elric hid behind the cleft in the rock, and the rebels continued
to press their advance. This time, Elric didn’t hesitate for a moment.
When the first rebel passed by, Elric pounced.
***

THE END OF THE BEGINNING

Rebellion plus 1 day
Elric pressed his shoulder against another angel’s on his left. An
angel on his right, about his size, pressed in from the right. Hundreds
of angels of his stature stood in a straight line in the front. Behind
them stood hundreds more with smaller frames. Tight ranks, grim
faces.
A single angel, larger than all of them, paced on a raised platform
in front. He stopped in the center of the platform, crossed his hands
behind his back, and announced with a booming voice, “My name
is Kai. I have been appointed as your . . . military . . . commander.
As of today, by order of the King, we are all designated elzurim—
warriors in the King’s service. We will serve mostly in the Middle
Realm, ministering to man and, as necessary, fighting against our new
enemy.”
The commander stopped and turned away from the ranks. He
bowed his head and let his arms drop to his sides. Turning back
around, he took a deep breath and raised his chin.
“We have entered a new time,” he said in a low and pensive voice.
“A day none of us could have ever imagined. But there is coming a
day, hidden in the deep counsel of the King, when He will set all
things right. Until then, we will fight for the Kingdom.”
The commander stood at attention and gazed over the ranks.
“You will be commissioned as officers. You will have warriors who
will serve under you, and you will have regions of responsibility. As
of this hour, I charge you—be valiant, be strong in the Lord. Rank
number one, you will be my captains. The remaining ranks, you are
lieutenants. Come forward now, line by line, and receive your new
tools. By my own hand, I give to you a sword and shield. Learn to

use them well. Captains shall wear two golden braids on your sleeves.
Lieutenants shall wear a single silver braid.”
Elric’s line made a right face and filed up the platform.
Commander Kai handed each warrior a sword and shield as he passed
by. With each step, Elric’s insides tied tighter and tighter into a knot.
I can’t believe this is happening. How did it come to this? How long before
the King vanquishes his foes and sets the Kingdom aright? One day . . .
one day . . .

HEROD THE GREAT

Birth minus 6 months

T

wo personal Roman guards of Herod the Great stood beside
thick marble columns outside an arched doorway and watched
the king talk to himself and make emotional gestures with his

arms as if having a heated argument with someone.

“He is going mad,” one guard said.
“Quiet, you fool. If you value your life.”
The young guard lowered his voice to a whisper. “But look at
him.”
“Pressures of maintaining so great a kingdom,” whispered the
seasoned guard.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Still standing at attention, the young guard barely moved his
lips. “It is more than stress. He is either mad or he has a demon.”
“This is your first day in the palace, isn’t it?” The older guard held
his stance and kept his eyes forward.
“Yes.”
“You will see many things. Remember your duties and do not
speak of anything outside this court.”
“Has he always been this way?”
“He has become worse over the years. It was a bloody rise to
power thirty years ago. You weren’t even born. There was a three–
year siege against Jerusalem. Assassinations. Political maneuvering.
Thousands were slaughtered. But he had the backing of the Roman
senate and the muscle of our army.”
“And now he controls all of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee. What,
then, is the problem?”
“The Jews. They hate him.”
The young guard waited a moment, then asked, “Why?”
“To begin with, he’s not even a true Jew—his father was a
descendant of a desert tribe that was forced into Judaism and his
mother was an Arab. The Sadducees hate him because he executed the
last of the old royal house—relatives of many of them. The Pharisees
hate him because he is a murderer and carries out capital punishments
without the approval of the Sanhedrin. The people hate him for his
heavy taxes and taste for blood.”
“Why does he not try to win them?”
“He did, at first. After the siege and a huge earthquake, he
rebuilt Jerusalem with a new market, a theater, an amphitheater, a

HEROD THE GREAT

meeting hall for the Sanhedrin, and a new royal palace. He expanded
Solomon’s temple site and built all the colonnades and courtyards.
But none of that helped. In fact, it only angered the Jews even more.
The architecture is too Roman, and he erected a Roman golden eagle
on top of the gate of the new temple.”
“So now he keeps the peace with an iron fist. The Roman army,
mercenaries, secret police.”
“He doesn’t care what they think anymore.”
The guards stood at attention with mouths shut tight. Herod
made a wide circle, passing near their post. Herod flailed his arms and
shouted, “None! I can trust none of them!”
Herod turned his back and walked away again, and the older
guard whispered, “This is his growing dread—his own family. You
just saw Antipater, his oldest son.”
“The one who told him that his sons Alexander and Aristobulus
were calling him ‘a shameless old man who dyes his hair’?”
“Yes. Antipater was banished with his mother when he was four
years old because Herod wanted to marry a Hasmonaean princess
named Mariamme. Now, eight wives and fourteen children later,
Herod has no one he can trust. Seven years ago, he called Antipater
back after thirty years of banishment. It appears to me that Antipater
is trying to eliminate competition for the throne.”
Herod paced close again, and the guards became like statues.
“Those insolent rebels,” Herod grumbled. “They go off to Rome
and get their Roman education and then come back here and try to
lord it over me. They are nothing but Hasmonaean aristocrats with
no idea of what it takes to be king. They hate me! I know it. And I
know they are trying to gain the support of my armies. They scheme

against me to overthrow my crown, and now they insult me in front
of others.” Herod raised his fist in the air and walked away from the
two guards.
“I have heard of Mariamme. I heard he had her killed,” the
younger guard whispered.
“He loved her.”
“What happened?”
“After Mark Antony’s defeat by Octavian, Herod went to Rome
to pledge his allegiance to Caesar. He received renewed support from
Rome and gained new territories. But when he returned, there was a
rumor that Mariamme had found another lover. The jealousy was too
much, and he had her executed.”
“Was the rumor true? Or did she love him?”
“She hated him. He had killed her grandfather to claim the
throne back in the early years. Then, in an effort to placate Jewish
leaders, he installed her brother Aristobulus as high priest. But
Aristobulus’s popularity grew, and Herod became jealous. Eventually,
Herod felt threatened, so he had Aristobulus drowned in a pool at his
palace in Jericho. She hated him.”
Herod stopped in front of a pillar. He kicked it. “What should I
do about these two insurgents?” He resumed his pacing and continued
to rant.
“He is obsessed with maintaining his kingdom,” the older guard
said.
“I still say he has a demon.”
***

HEROD THE GREAT

11

The great demon commander, Molech, peered out at the Physical
Realm through the eyes of his human host, Herod, and threw his
exasperated hands up.
“What should I do about these two insurgents?” he said.
The demon paced, using the legs of his human puppet. A
company of beaelzurim attendants lined the royal court, watching
their commander, waiting for blood.
“I cannot let this kind of disrespect go unchecked. I could take
them out of my will. No, that is not enough. I know, I shall go ask
her. She is the only one who understands, the only one who truly
loves me. She will know what to do.”
Molech walked his human puppet, Herod, out of the throne
room and deep down to the secret place, the ultra–private chamber
where he alone could go. The special place where he kept her.
The small square room had no windows. On the marble walls
hung two iron sconces with torches that cast a dim and eerie yellow
glow about the room and left many deep shadows. In the center of
the room on a raised marble pedestal stood a large clay jar. In the
jar, his Mariamme, embalmed in honey, preserved forever, waited for
him with all her love.
The demon lord and Herod entered the secret chamber and
closed the thick wooden door. It made a cold, thumping echo. On
the stone bench by the pedestal sat a grotesque demon with wild,
glowing red eyes, exposed blood–stained fangs, and massive studded
arms. The two demons flashed fiendish smiles at each other. Herod’s
eyes saw the figure sitting on the bench—the lovely spirit form of his
long–lost wife. She looked as beautiful as the day he took her for his
own, and she smiled lovingly at him, the way she always did.

12

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Hello, my love,” she cooed. “I have missed you.”
He dragged himself across the room and slumped down beside
her.
“What is it, dear?” she asked. “I can tell something is troubling
you.”
“Alexander and Aristobulus. They are trying to take over the
throne. And they continue to malign me in public. What am I to
do?”
Mariamme didn’t flinch, “Kill them.”
“I was afraid you wouldn’t approve. They are sons we had
together.”
“Anyone who tries to usurp your crown is no son of mine. I say
you have to execute them. In fact, I think you should take one of the
golden cords that tie back the canopy of my bed—which I know you
still keep untouched in the palace—and use it to strangle them before
your eyes while you sit on your throne. Let this be a sign to all the
glory–hungry sons who have an eye toward your kingdom.”
“I knew you would understand. We have always had such a
strong connection. I love you so much.”
“And I love you. Now, go and do this thing. You must not delay.”
Herod stood at the door for a moment and looked back at his
love. He then went to her old room and retrieved the cord. After
taking his place in the throne room, he summoned the two brothers.
He presented the charges against them with cold composure. They
denied all the charges and pledged their allegiance to him. He flung
the cord down at their feet.
“Do you know what this is? This is a cord that belonged to your
mother, whom I loved. But by it today you will pay the price for your
treachery.”

HEROD THE GREAT

13

With a simple motion of Herod’s hand, the executioner picked
up the rope and strangled the life out of both of Herod’s sons.
“Let this be a lesson to anyone who thinks they can ascend to my
throne. Remove these dogs from my sight.”
The demon from Mariamme’s chamber stood over the bodies
and laughed. The hundred other demons in the throne room cheered
and shouted and flew around the room in a feverous frenzy. A small
snake with knowing eyes watched from the dark corner. His forked
black tongue shot in and out. The snake’s glowing red eyes turned to
slits, and he slithered off without a sound.
Herod retired to his bedroom, seething over who else might be
seeking to betray him.

n the magi temple in Persia, a man with a white beard
wearing colorful night robes rushed down the hall. The
flickering lantern he held out at arm’s length drove away the

night shadows in the hall, and the pad, pad, pad of his leather sandals on
the smooth stone floor passed by two . . . three unlit wall sconces. No
time to stop and light them now. He veered left into a dark bed chamber.

With the lantern in one hand, Melchior nudged Caspar with the
other. “Caspar, wake up. Wake up. You must come and look at this.”
Caspar roused at the sound of the excitement in Melchior’s voice,
scowled, and rubbed his eyes. He slipped on a robe, and the two

hurried outside. They stopped in front of a wood table and chairs.
Rolled parchments, layers of astrological charts, and measurement
instruments lay strewn across the table. Melchoir pushed a stack of
charts aside and set the lantern on the table.
Melchior pointed upward into the heavens. “There . . . rising in
the east. What do you make of it?”
“It looks like the royal star, Hormoz.”
“Yes, I agree. And with it rising in the east, we are entering a time
most powerful to bestow a new king.”
“True, but this is not remarkable.”
“There is more. The sun is in Varak, where it is exalted.”
“Hmm. A powerful king.”
“And . . . notice that Keyvân is also present. That means the
three rulers of the Varak trine are present.”
Caspar eased into a chair. “This is amazing. We must be on the
brink of the introduction of a great king indeed.”
“And that is just the beginning.” Melchior shuffled his
astronomical plots on the table and moved his instruments out of the
way. He pulled the lantern close to the parchment. “According to my
calculations, we should see a conjunction of Hormoz and Keyvân . . .
and the moon . . . within the next four weeks!”
Caspar jumped to his feet and looked at Melchior’s charts with
wild excitement in his eyes. For several minutes he kept checking
the projections and muttering, “Incredible, incredible.” He stepped
back and gazed up at Hormoz with an enormous smile beaming
from beneath his long mustache and beard. “An event like this would
happen only once in several lifetimes. This is the most significant
thing we will ever see. Go wake Balthazar.”

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

16

In the main study, the walls were lined with open compartments
containing rolled up scrolls. Balthazar examined the projected
trajectories by lamplight. The three sat around the charts, looking at
each other with childlike excitement.
“This will not be some ordinary king,” Balthazar stuttered. “We
are most fortunate to be poised to see this. An alignment like this is
unfathomable. From where do we think the king will arise?”
Melchior didn’t hesitate. “Hormoz is in Varak, the ram—which
is the sign of the Jews. This king will have to come from somewhere
in Judea, Samaria, or Palestine . . . but we have no way of knowing
exactly where.”
***
In the corner of the magi’s study, a small demon named Nangar
rubbed his hands up and down his spindly, ashen arms and licked
his lips. The dim glow of the lamplight on the magi’s maps could not
reach into the dark corner where he kept his presence hidden from
the men.
Nangar breathed a silky stream of smoke into the spiritual air.
“Where? Where indeed. This is the question,” he whispered.
Marr believes he has the coming King surrounded in Egypt. What if
he is wrong? What if they are all wrong? What if the King enters through
a place in Israel, and none knows the location? Nangar rubbed his hands
over his smooth, bald head and smirked. What if I could use these
Zoroastrian priests to somehow lead me to Him?
These men—these wise, educated, sophisticated men—they believe
all the lofty lies I have built up over the centuries. They sit here in their

temple-observatory and study the stars while I combine their mathematics
and mysticism to make them believe their lives are governed by the
constellations. I have them. And now I shall use them to help me find the
ultimate prize.
The three priests double checked their star maps. Nangar
smirked. I need to move them to conduct a thorough search in Israel. It
is a very long journey from Persia, though. They must be convinced that
the king they seek is worthy of their homage. But I cannot have them start
believing in the Creator King. Nangar licked his lips again and nodded
his head. They are earnest and thoughtfully benevolent men. I will appeal
to their intellectual curiosity and rely on their desire for enlightenment.
They will make the journey. They will lead me to the hidden King.
“We must learn more about this coming king of Israel.” Nangar
spoke into the smoky air of the Middle Realm. “We must conduct a
search and find where he is to be born. We should search the archives
for prophecies. Perhaps we can even go and honor the new king with
gifts and well-wishes.”
***
Birth minus 6 hours
Four weeks of anticipation passed, and clear skies over Persia
brought energized excitement to the magi temple. Caspar, Melchior,
and Balthazar placed their measuring instruments and charts and
scrolls on a table outside and prepared for the astrological event of a
lifetime. Engrossed in a flurry of activity, they tracked the moon and
the great traveling stars Hormoz and Keyvân. For several hours, they
took measurements, recorded positions, plotted paths.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“It looks like our predictions about the triple conjunction are
accurate,” Melchior said.
“Truly, this is going to happen,” Balthazar whispered.
The time drew close, all the activities ceased, and the three
became silent. Closer and closer the heavenly lights drew together.
All three men marveled with their awestruck bearded chins hanging
down to their chests.
“Here it is! Here it is!”
The triple conjunction.
“The rest of the world sleeps, with no idea of this wonder.”
“Historic. Amazing.”
Their gaping mouths turned into enormous, satisfied grins, and
their eyes twinkled back at the silent, starry performers in the sky.
Silent. Distant. Well-ordered and . . .
Flash! Within a blink, the heavens opened up, and a multitude
of angels appeared in the sky in front of the wandering stars. Rows
upon rows of angelic beings came into view, all shining as bright as
lightning and full of radiant colors. Trumpets started—loud, clear,
and magnificent.
Each of the magi released a high–pitched yelp and flailed and
jumped and fumbled around like startled rabbits. A faltering misstep
knocked over the table with the scrolls and instruments, sending all
the implements clattering to the ground.
The initial panic swept past them, and the spectacle overtook
their entire conscious thought. Their legs became too weak to stand,
and they sank to their knees with their eyes frozen on the heavens.
Angels, or heavenly beings of some kind, sang about the birth of the
Son of God. Trumpets, voices, regal majesty shook the heavens and
pounded against their chests.

THE MAGI

19

The music finished. A giant explosion of light. A dark, starry sky.
Silence.
Flat on their backs, with streaming eyes and glowing faces,
Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar glanced across the ground at each
other.
“What . . . was that?” Caspar stuttered.
“Never have I . . . ” Balthazar slurred.
“In all our studies,” Melchior stammered, “nothing could have
prepared us for this.”
They lay still for several minutes, breathing and gawking at the
dark, empty sky. Balthazar sat up first. Caspar and Melchior followed.
With all the stoic dignity he could muster, Caspar stood and righted
the table. Balthazar gathered parchments and set them back on the
table in a neat array. He spread the main tracking chart out in the
center. Caspar relit the toppled lamp. Melchior restored the fallen
instruments to the table.
Melchior cleared his throat and with a calm, analytical voice
said, “We knew we were on the brink of the coming of a great king.”
“Yes,” said Balthazar, “but it appears we underestimated his
importance. This is not just a great king. This is a King of kings.
Could it be that this is the very Son of God himself?”
“That is what I heard from the . . . whatever they were . . . ”
Caspar said matter-of-factly. He set the lamp on the table next to the
charts.
Balthazar said, “This would mean that there is one true God of
all creation?”
They each stood in silence for several minutes, gazing into the
heavens.

“What shall we do?” Melchior asked.
They grouped around the table and looked at each other with
blank stares.
***
Birth plus 15 minutes
Nangar stepped out of the shadows and stood beside the
perplexed magi. They needed answers. He could guide them. “You
must seek him out,” he said. “This is, indeed, a thing of great wonder;
and you desire to know all knowledge. For the sake of knowledge and
understanding, you should make every effort to find the child and see
him with your own eyes.”
I need to get them to take their focus off the touch they received in
their spirits. Need to engage their intellect.
“For the sake of knowledge and understanding,” he repeated.
His words shot like fiery darts and penetrated their spirits.
“We should try to find him,” said Balthazar. “Seeing his star is
one thing, but seeing him in person would be something altogether
more interesting.”
The other two nodded and stroked their beards.
Melchior said, “And how shall we find him? We know only that
he is born in Israel.”
Balthazar answered, “I said it weeks ago . . . prophecies in the
ancient scrolls—there has to be something in there that—”
“Balthazar,” Caspar interrupted, “we have looked. The only thing
we have found is some vague reference to a king’s star in the east.”
“But there are many more scrolls. We need to continue searching.”

Nangar whispered soothing words, “He is right. It is in there
to be found. I will guide you. Together we can unlock the hidden
secrets. Together we will find the child.”

Birth plus 8 hours
Daniel sprinted toward his base camp just outside of Bethlehem
from the field where he had been watching the sheep. He had waited
half the night for the shepherds to return from Bethlehem, and the
news about the newborn King felt like it would explode within him.
He had seen the angels in the sky. The other shepherds saw them,
too—and they had actually gone to see the baby. Daniel couldn’t wait
to tell his father.
Out of breath, Daniel burst into his father’s tent. “Father! Father!
Wake up! The most amazing thing happened tonight!”
Jeremiah slept on a colorful rug bed mat, but roused quickly.
“What is it Daniel? What’s wrong?”
“Did you hear them? They were so loud!”
“Hear what, Daniel?”
“The angels! There were thousands of them! How could you
sleep through it?”
“What time is it?”
“I don’t know. Almost morning. I wanted to come straight here
after it happened, but the other shepherds needed my help, and I
figured you probably saw it anyway, and—”
“Daniel, slow down and start from the beginning. What are you
talking about?”

22

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Daniel rolled his eyes, took a dramatic breath, and said in his
most grown-up voice. “I was out on the hillside with Jesse. We were
talking, and then, all of a sudden, up in the sky I saw thousands of
angels. They were all different colors and they filled the sky. They
blew loud trumpets and sang an amazing song. They sang about the
Messiah being born! The song said that He is coming to deliver us!”
“Angels?”
“Yes, I saw them! And I heard them!”
“Oh, Daniel.”
“You don’t believe me?”
“Well, it is not a matter of belief. It is . . . how long did you say
you were out there with Jesse?”
“I’m not sure. It seemed like forever.”
“Then that explains it—you must have fallen asleep and had a
dream.”
“No! This was no dream. I was wide awake. I know what I saw.”
“But angels? I do not think—”
“Don’t think they exist? Just because those Sadducees said that
doesn’t mean they’re right. I saw them!”
“What about Jesse? Did he see them, too?”
Just because Jesse didn’t see it, it’s going to be impossible to get Father
to believe me.
Daniel paused for a moment and answered in a dejected tone,
“No. I don’t think so.”
“How do you explain that? If there were thousands of angels
singing a song and making a great noise, do you not think he would
have seen them?”
“But I saw them. I know I did.”

“I don’t doubt that you think you saw something, Daniel. But
you must have been having a fantastic dream. It is the only thing that
makes sense. I think you should . . . ”
Daniel flung open the tent flap, ran to the edge of the hillside,
and plopped down. Sitting all alone in the darkness, he fought back
the tears and the lump in his throat. A nearby sheep bleated.
Stupid sheep.
The dew from the patch of grass seeped through the back of his
tunic.
Stupid grass. Stupid everything. This whole year has been stupid.
First, I almost died, and then I lost my hearing. Father blames Levi,
which is stupid. And Jesse . . . he’s too much like Father. And those stupid
Sadducees. No angels? Then what did I see tonight? No Messiah? Then
what were those . . . whatever they were . . . singing about? It’s all stupid.
Am I the only one around here that sees that nothing in this stupid world
makes sense? So what if some baby king was born last night? What’s he
going to do to help me?

n Bethlehem, early in the morning after Jesus’ birth, a quiet,
persistent rapping at the stable door behind an inn broke the
morning silence. Elric stood by the door and watched. Jenli

stood beside him. Inside, Joseph roused and peered from around the
corner of the stable door at a bright–eyed lady of fifty, stepping side to
side, wringing her hands.

“Yes,” Joseph said, wiping the sleep from his baggy eyes.
“Good morning,” the lady said. “I am Miriam.”
Joseph answered with raised eyebrows and a puzzled look.
“Omer’s wife.” She paused. “The innkeepers.”

The lights came on in Joseph’s eyes. “Yes, yes, of course, good
morning.”
“Oh, my heavens, it’s true then,” Miriam said, peeking around
Joseph into the stable. She squeezed in past him. “Omer told me
this morning that he had set you up in here. Of course, if I had
known last night, I would have done something about it. Sometimes
I wonder about that man. Silly old goat. Sending a girl in labor out
to a filthy animal stable . . . oh, the indignity! But it seems you made
it through? And this is the little one? Oh, so precious. Is it a boy or a
girl? Wait, don’t tell me . . . I can usually tell just by looking at their
little face—some of the ladies say I have a special gift for doing that.
In fact, last week one of our neighbor’s daughters had a baby—I took
one look and I knew—‘It’s a girl, isn’t it?’ I said. And I was right. They
all couldn’t believe it. Except for my neighbor, of course. She has seen
me do that for years. So then . . . let me take a look at you, darling.”
She paused for only a moment. “He is a boy?”
Mary nodded.
“I knew it,” Miriam continued. “I can always tell. And a beautiful,
healthy–looking boy at that. He even has some hair. It’s so sweet—
you know, sometimes they come out bald as can be. Two of mine did.
Not a single hair. It grows in eventually, of course, but I think they are
cuter when they have some hair to start with. So, you truly gave birth
right here? Without a midwife? Oh,my, you poor thing.”
She turned to Joseph. “That means you must have done the
delivering? Well, you are a very courageous young man.” She patted
his cheek with her open hand. “I am very, very sorry that you had
to start your family like this. If I had known last night, I could have
done something. He’s not a heartless man, of course—but he doesn’t

always think things all the way through. He actually thought he was
doing you a favor. Imagine that! And then when he told me
about you this morning, I had to come out here to see how things
were going. I was actually hoping you hadn’t delivered yet so I
could get you out of this animal shelter before the baby came. Well,
I guess it is too late for that. But now, let me try to make things up
to you a little. Come, my dear, we should get you into the house and
get you cleaned up. A good bath and a real bed is what you need.
Have you had breakfast? Oh, listen to me. Of course you haven’t
had breakfast. I will fix you something nice. And get you and the
baby cleaned up.”
“The blanket,” Elric spoke to Miriam. “Wrap the Child in
this blanket.”
Jenli shook his head. “Better speak it again, Captain. I
don’t think she . . . ”
Miriam’s fidgeting eyes passed by the special tunic on the
shelf left by Elric the night before. She paused.
Elric smiled.
“Here, here,” Miriam said, grabbing the blanket. “We should
wrap him in this nice blanket before we take him outside. Ooh,
feel this. It’s so soft.”
Elric motioned to Jenli. Jenli disappeared.
Joseph took the Baby, and Miriam helped him wrap the Baby in
the blanket. Miriam pulled Mary to her feet, and they stepped out
into the morning air. Miriam moved with quick, energetic gestures,
but her pace remained patient and nurse-like for Mary’s slow, tiny
steps.
Elric took calm steps with his head straight forward, but his eyes
darted all around the house and yard. The top of Jenli’s head on the

neighbor’s roof . . . Brondor behind that corner . . . Kaylar’s eyes
peering through that wall—Jenli’s team held a tight perimeter, each
poised at the highest alert for the King’s first movement out in the
open. With the Child wrapped in the tunic, the enemy should be unable
to perceive His spirit. But I would prefer not to test that this early in the
game.
Miriam’s voice prattled on in the background, but Elric’s attention
remained in the Middle Realm. “Keep moving,” he whispered. “We
need to get Him back indoors.”
Miriam held Mary’s hand and steadied her with each step.
“What are you in town for? Wait, don’t tell me . . . it’s for the census,
right? I knew it. That’s why everybody is here. I have never seen so
many people in this city. It is good for the business, of course, but I
shall be glad when things get back to normal. So many strangers and
so much commotion. Plus, it brings in extra Roman soldiers, and
I think we all could do without that. They march around like they
own the place and . . . oh, be careful, dear. Slow down, we are in no
hurry. You are doing fine. What you need is a good hot meal, a nice
bath, and a soft bed. I am going to set you up in a spare bedroom we
have in our own house until you are feeling stronger. We will figure
out the details later. For now, we need to get you in and cleaned up.
If I had known last night, I would have had you in there already. It is
unthinkable—having a baby in a stable. That man of mine. We are
almost there, and you are doing well. You are such a sweet young lady.
You don’t talk much though, do you? That’s fine, let’s get you in and
settled—then maybe you will feel more like talking.”
The procession reached the back door of the house. Miriam
opened it and gestured for Joseph to go in. “Omer, we have company,”

she called out into the house. “That’s it, dear. We’re almost there.
Only a few more steps.”
The door closed. Everyone inside. Out of sight. Elric nodded to
Jenli, took one last glance around the area, and backed into the house.
***
With the morning meal done and the two women and the Baby
in the back room, Joseph and Omer found themselves alone for the
first time to carry the conversation on their own. Elric stood against
the side wall and listened to the men’s conversation. The incessant
bubbling of Miriam’s banter wafted in from behind the wall, and
Omer gave Joseph a man–to–man see–what–I–have–to–live–with
kind of smile and tried to get their conversation started.
“Joseph, you are from Nazareth, and you are here for the census?”
“Mm-hmm.”
“Right.” Omer looked around the room, down at his feet, and
then back to Joseph. “Tell me, what do you do for a living back in
Nazareth?”
“I am a carpenter,” Joseph replied. “I like to work with wood
mostly, but I can do any carpentry work—masonry, roof work,
fencing.”
“Ask him if he needs a carpenter,” Elric said to Joseph.
The two men sat in silence nodding their heads. Then, a spark
flashed in Joseph’s eyes as though a thought had occurred to him. “Do
you know anyone who is looking for the services of a carpenter?”
“You need a carpenter,” Elric said to Omer.

29

Omer scratched his chin. “Why? Are you not headed back home
after you register?”
“Well . . . no. We have no home back in Nazareth now, and I’m
afraid everything we own is on those two carts out back.”
The Baby’s cry rang out from the back room.
A visible lump formed in Joseph’s throat, and his eyes filled with
tears. Omer looked toward the back room and then down at his feet.
Omer cleared his throat.
“Where are you headed from here?” Omer asked.
“We don’t know. Maybe Jerusalem. Wherever I can find work,
I suppose.”
Omer’s eyebrows raised. He sat up and slapped his knee and
announced, “We are both in luck! What a coincidence—I happen
to have some carpentry work that I need done myself. Remember, I
told you about the roof damage to two of our rooms and the broken
awning? Do you think you could do those repairs?”
“I could take a look. I’m pretty sure I could take care of whatever
damage is there.”
“Would you like to take a look at it right now? The women will
be busy for a while.”
The two men excused themselves and headed out into the
morning sunshine with a purposeful pace. They inspected the damage
from the ground and from atop the roof and from inside the rooms.
They discussed repair plans with much pointing and gesturing and
nodding of heads. They discussed needed supplies and local vendors.
They discussed a possible schedule. They discussed possible wages,
including some ideas for barter. A full hour passed before the two
men returned to Omer’s house where the two ladies waited.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

They told the women about the repair plans, and after more
discussions, mostly led by Miriam, they reached a decision. Joseph
and Mary would stay with Omer and Miriam until Joseph could
complete the repairs enough for the damaged rooms to be habitable.
Then he and Mary would move into one of the rooms. Omer would
provide the funds for the needed materials, and for Joseph’s labor the
young couple could stay in the inn room rent-free. The room would
be theirs for the full length of days for Mary’s purification according
to the law of Moses. At the end of those forty days, Joseph and Mary
would make the customary journey to Jerusalem to present the Child
to the Lord and offer a sacrifice at the temple. After that Joseph didn’t
know where they would live, and they would have to trust the Lord
to provide something. If he could find work in Jerusalem and a place
to live, they would stay there. If that didn’t work out, he and Mary
were welcome to stay in their room at the inn for a modest rent, and
Omer could give Joseph some leads for jobs.
Elric smiled. The details of life—how I love helping men weave
their individual strands of thread into the great tapestry of the King. If
only they could see the magnificent design they were a part of.

oseph weaved his way through a large crowd at the census
registration center. Jenli walked beside him and spoke to him
while scanning the crowd. Local and Roman officials shouted

orders and directed the movements of the assemblage. Roman soldiers
stood at their posts with their menacing spear tips standing high above
the heads of the milling crowd. Jenli shook his head and scowled.

Look at these faces, thought Jenli. The familiar look of an oppressed
people enduring yet another indignity under an iron–handed regime.
They submit and follow directions like sheep. The sorrow in their eyes.
Defeat. Hopelessness.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Like the rest, Joseph set his course toward the center of the
assembly area, straining for the instructions being barked out by an
official.
Amid the crowd of people, dozens of elzurim and beaelzurim
mixed and maneuvered. Other than an occasional shove or threat,
they maintained their charges and kept moving.
Stop looking at their faces and concentrate. Where is he? Where is
he? He should . . . there!
Across the courtyard, at the outer fringes of the crowd, Jenli’s
warrior Jerem pressed inward. Beside him, his charge. Jerem’s eyes
scanned left to right through the crowd. Over here. Over here. Jerem’s
eyes met Jenli’s. The angelic link was made. Jerem leaned down and
whispered to his charge, and Jenli did the same to Joseph. He stood
back up and waited. Jerem spoke to his man again. The man’s face lit
up. He bounced up and down and craned his neck over the people’s
heads.
“Joseph! Joseph, is that you?” the man called over the commotion.
Joseph stopped and turned his head left and right.
“Joseph!” the man shouted. “Over here.”
Joseph’s gaze flashed from face to face. The man waved his arm
and bounced with a broad smile.
“Rabbi?” Joseph called out, waving back.
Raziel, the rabbi from Nazareth—the one who had performed
Joseph and Mary’s wedding ceremony—waved again and shouted,
“Joseph! What a surprise!”
Joseph gave up his quest to make it to the front and wound his
way through the crowd toward Raziel. They met each other with a
traditional kiss on each cheek and bright surprised smiles.

33

Jerem stepped up with a smile.
“Right on time,” Jenli complimented.
“You too.”
“Rabbi Raziel,” Joseph almost shouted from excitement, “what
are you doing here?”
Raziel laughed. “Master Zeev sent me out on some affairs of the
synagogue. I am visiting the synagogues in several towns for the next
month or so. This week, I am here in Bethlehem. I think I could be
accomplishing more at home, but he was adamant that I take the trip.
Sometimes I don’t know where he comes up with some of his ideas.”
He laughed again. “But he is the master. So here I am!”
Jenli and Jerem smiled.
“But why come down here into this mess?” Joseph asked,
motioning toward the crowd.
“Oh, I don’t know. I had a feeling I needed to get out and mingle
with the people. I knew the census was in progress, and I knew it was
a major event, so I wanted to see it. I am a little surprised to see how
many people are out here. It is amazing. Actually, I am grateful to have
an opportunity to see it. What about you? What brings you here?”
“The census.”
“Oh, yes, of course. Bethlehem for the line of David. How are
you and Mary doing? I haven’t seen you for a few months. Actually,
she must be close to her due date?”
“As a matter of fact, she delivered the night before last.”
“Congratulations!” Raziel burst out with an enormous hug
which lifted Joseph off the ground. “This is wonderful news! Wait.
How could you have found out so quickly unless . . . unless Mary is
not in Nazareth.”

34

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“She is here, too. The Baby was born here in Bethlehem.”
“Bethlehem?” Raziel shouted. And then in almost a whisper,
“Bethlehem? Joseph, do you realize what this means?”
Raziel pulled Joseph out and away where they could have more
privacy. They stopped beneath a stand of palm trees. Joseph looked
around with a puzzled expression. Raziel looked like he would burst.
“Back before I married the two of you, you told me about some
amazing signs. I didn’t doubt the things you thought you saw, but I
wanted see how things unfolded before I made up my mind about
what it all might mean. I wanted to believe it, but there was one thing
that did not seem to make sense. While there is a somewhat obscure
reference in the prophets about the Messiah being called a Nazarene,
it is commonly accepted that He would come from Bethlehem. It is
in the prophet Micah: ‘But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too
little to be among the clans of Judah, from you One will go forth for
Me to be ruler in Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, from the
days of eternity.’ I couldn’t understand how He was going to be from
Bethlehem when you lived in Nazareth. But now, here you are, and
He actually was born in Bethlehem!”
Prickly bumps appeared on his arms and his eyes welled up. He
rubbed his forehead. “This could actually be the Messiah. This . . .
could . . . actually be . . . ” He collapsed to his knees. The small cloud
of dust that rose from his knees settled as he continued to rub his
forehead. “How many people know about all this?” Raziel said, his
voice low.
“There is Mary’s family, but I don’t think they believe it. You, of
course. And then there were four shepherds who showed up on the
night of His birth—they said they saw a vision and . . . ”

“A vision? Of what? Angels again?”
“Yes, one spoke to them and told them where to find us, and
then they saw a whole host of angels in the sky.”
“Incredible, and then, what else?”
“I told them most of what we had seen and been through. They
gave us a gift and then left. They are the only other ones we have
talked to.”
“Good. That is good. I don’t know why, but something inside
me tells me it is best to keep this to ourselves for now. It’s not that I
don’t believe you—trust me—I am very excited about this. But, if this
truly is the Promised One, He will take His place in the proper time
without any promotion from us. I suspect it will be best to let Him
grow without the distractions from a multitude of well–meaning,
and not–so–well–meaning, religious leaders. Also, simply making the
claim could bring down the unwanted wrath of a jealous king. Herod
is ruthless and has a very long reach.”
Joseph nodded.
“Tell me,” Raziel said, “what do you have planned for His
circumcision?”
“I hadn’t gotten that far yet. I assume I will bring Him to the
local synagogue.”
“No, no, that will not be necessary. I shall . . . ” Raziel stopped,
as if pulling in the reins of a runaway horse. “Forgive me, I am
presumptuous. If it pleases you, I would be very honored to perform
the ceremony myself. And I will be most happy to come to wherever
you are staying and do it.”
“Yes, of course.”

“This is the third time we have seen him,” Jenli said.
“First, he was turned away at the border of Bethlehem on the night of
the King’s birth. The day before yesterday, one of my warriors chased
him out of the house next door.”
Elric scowled. “How did he get inside our perimeter?”
“We don’t know. And then today, we caught him trying to sneak
through again.”
“Is he a local?”

“No sir. I don’t recognize him. He is a lieutenant. Blotchy red
skin. And one eye that is half-closed.”
“Luchek,” Elric said with a grimace.
“Do you know him, Captain?”
“Yes. I mean, I used to.” Elric shook his head. “He is the one
who attacked in Nazareth.”
“Do you think he knows?”
Elric paused a moment. “He knows.”
Jenli reached for his sword. “We must capture him before he
gives away our location.”
“I wonder,” Elric said. “You said you caught him trying to sneak
in today?”
“Yes.”
“Why?” Elric rubbed his chin. “Why would he delay in telling
his superiors?”
Mary and Miriam continued their own conversation in the
Physical Realm. The Baby slept. Elric stared at the King in silence. He
looks so tiny. So human.
“He’s not going to deliver Him to his master,” Elric said. “Not
yet. He wants the glory of leading the attack. And he knows he can’t
launch an assault by himself, even if there are only a few of us. So, he
will gather for himself a band of beaelzurim he can control. He will
surround us and wait for an opportune time.”
Jenli’s hand went back to his sword.
Elric smirked. “And we are going to allow it.”
“Captain?”
“You and I or a member of your team will always be present here
to protect Him in case any of Luchek’s team becomes too impetuous,

but the rest of your team will form a loose outer perimeter and allow
Luchek’s team to think they are operating at will.”
“A risky operation,” Jenli said. He raised skeptical eyebrows.
“What will this accomplish?”
Elric smiled. “Picture a dog with a bone he has found. What will
happen if another dog tries to get close?”
Jenli smiled and nodded. “He will chase the other dog off. We
are going to let the enemy do the job of providing a perimeter around
us.”
“Exactly.”
“How long do you think this perimeter will hold before they
attack?”
“I don’t know, but I expect it will be a while. Gathering a team
without the use of brute force will be a challenge for Luchek. It makes
our timing with Zaben more complicated.”
Jenli nodded. “Shall I brief my team?”
“Yes, and tell them to watch for my signal. When the battle does
start, we are going to need every sword.”
***
On the outskirts of Bethlehem, in a dank cave, away from the
light of the sun, and away from the attention of everyone, three
demons held a secret meeting.
The largest demon, the lieutenant Luchek, whispered his message.
“And then, if all that is not proof enough, when the shepherds were
worshiping, the two elzurim knelt and worshipped, too. You know
they would never bow to anyone but the King.” Luchek’s words

40

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

formed rank clouds in the stagnant air. One small demon trembled
with excitement as another would–be recruit listened to Luchek’s
pitch.
“Yes, but did you actually see Him in the flesh?” the recruit said.
“Briefly, when they moved into the house.”
“What did He look like?”
“I don’t know—like any normal human infant. He was wrapped
in a blanket.”
“This is what makes your claim unbelievable. How is it possible
that the King should look like a normal human? And what about the
cherubim? They always go before Him.”
“Do you not see? It’s all part of His plan. He is treacherous and
vindictive. He is making a mockery of Marr down in Egypt while He
sets a trap here in Bethlehem.” He paused a moment for the dramatic
effect. “But He didn’t count on me!”
“Do you think He doesn’t know what you are scheming? There
is nothing hidden from His sight.”
“Are you so sure about that? How is it, then, that I was able
to recognize Him, pinpoint His exact location, and almost get close
enough to touch Him? I think there are shadows too deep for even
His eyes.”
“If you were that close, why did you not attack when you had
the chance?”
Luchek squirmed and scowled through his good eye. “The
captain who is guarding the child—I fought with him already, and I
know he is too much for me. That is why I’m forming this team. We
need sufficient numbers to deal a decisive blow and claim our prize
for our master.”

“For Marr.”
“No! Not for that pompous sycophant. I hate him. I’m glad he is
going to be humiliated by his grand campaign down in Egypt. We will
deliver the prize to Satan himself and gain all the glory for ourselves.”
His blood–red eye bulged, and he clenched powerful taloned fists.
“Think of it. We will be made mighty princes in the new kingdom,
and I will take great joy in putting my foot on the back of Marr’s neck
and forcing him to serve me.”
The recruit sneered with a wicked, jagged tooth, “Very well, I am
with you, but I—”
“Good. Here are my terms. I am running this operation. You
will do only what I say and only when I say to do it. You are to tell
no one about our business. If any other demon starts to get anywhere
near our center of operations, you are to divert him away without
disclosing any information about what we are hiding. You are not
to engage any enemy warriors until the day we make our attack. Let
them come and go while you stay concealed as much as possible. We
need them to think everything is normal and that they are in control.
We cannot afford to raise any suspicions.”
The new recruit fidgeted under the barrage of orders being
levied upon him, and Luchek could tell he resented coming under his
control. That subordinate resentment, though, only fueled his own
sense of power and authority, and he continued his orders with long
dramatic inflections.
“We are going to take our time. Maybe a year or more. I will do
all the recruiting for the team, and I will build our numbers slowly
so as to not raise any suspicions. We will be an ever–present shadow,
hidden from the eyes of the King and those of His forces—until the

42

time is exactly right, and then we will crush them when they least
expect it.”
The new recruit made an oath of allegiance there in the darkness,
even though Luchek knew such oaths meant little between such self–
serving creatures. It all gave Luchek a grand sense of power.

Elric and Jenli stood outside Omer’s home with vigilant eyes and
crossed arms.
“Day eight,” Jenli said.
“Mmm,” Elric answered as he watched Raziel approach on the
dirt street. “The shadows around us grow.”
Raziel crossed the outer ring of shadows and the inner ring of
Jenli’s team with a bounce in his step and a large ceremonial pouch in
his hands. He hummed a happy tune. He passed through Elric and
Jenli and into Omer’s house.
“Come inside. This is a very important day,” Elric said to Jenli.
Jenli nodded, and they stepped inside.
All preparations had been made with care. Ceremonial candles
sparkled throughout the room; the Chair of Elijah sat ready; glasses
of wine stood by; and Mary held the Baby.
“A small gathering for an occasion as special as a Brit Milah,”
Elric said.
Jenli shrugged and replied, “With no family around and no
friends in a strange city, there is no one to share this sacred event with
besides Omer and Miriam.”

“I am pleased we were able to have Raziel serve as the Mohel,”
Elric said.
Miriam floated and beamed like a grandmother.
“Miriam will serve as the Kvatterin?” Elric asked.
“Yes, and Omer is the Kvatter,” Jenli replied.
Omer paced, wringing his hands and grinning.
Raziel began by reminding everyone that this sacred event had
been observed since the time the Lord made His covenant with
Abraham—the physical sign that distinguished the Hebrews from the
rest of the nations. It represented a most solemn oath, and yet it
was a time of great joy and celebration.
“How many of these have you observed over the centuries?”
Elric said to Jenli.
“Thousands. Every one sacred and full of hope.”
“Every time I can’t help but be amazed with how the King has
fulfilled His promises to Abraham. Even during the darkest times
when the enemy either nearly destroyed the descendants of Abraham
or dispersed them into bondage, the King always preserved a remnant
of His people. He has been faithful to His chosen people, and today
He is going to fulfill another promise and become one of them.”
Elric looked at the five simple humans in the house and shook
his head.
“Without the backdrop of all the battles fought by men and
angels since the beginning, these people can’t begin to comprehend
the event that is about to take place.”
The air in the Middle Realm carried the sweet smell of the Spirit.
I wonder if the people can sense it.
“I sense intense delight from the King,” Jenli said.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Yes,” Elric said, “and the pride of the Father. How does this
powerful love not burst the walls of this puny earthly dwelling?”
The official ceremony began. The Kvatterin handed the Child
to the Kvatter, and all the people in the room recited the traditional
blessing. The Kvatter then placed the Baby on the Chair of Elijah
and the Mohel recited the accompanying prayer. Then, the Kvatter
lifted the Baby and passed Him to the lap of Joseph, the Sandek.
After another blessing, the Mohel performed the circumcision
accompanied by the cries of the tiny baby Boy.
In that moment, Elric sensed a strange bittersweet emotion in
the spirit. It surprised him. He thought he felt the Father wince as
He watched His Son endure His first pinch of a painful world. At the
same time, Elric felt a strong sense of satisfaction from the Father—
not in the pain itself, but in the fulfillment of purpose that the pain
represented.
Then, he saw . . .
Blood! Not just any blood. This is the blood of the King of the
Heavens!
Elric’s sword flew out of its sheath. He held it in the ready
position with a trembling hand. His mouth hung open wide, and his
eyes filled with tears. He dropped the tip of his sword downward and
looked over at Jenli, who knelt with his face flat to the ground. “Until
today,” Elric whispered, “I have never seen the King’s blood shed.
And I hope to never see it again.”
The rest of the ceremony—the various blessings, the passing of
the Baby to the standing Sandek, the cup of wine—all passed before
Elric like a dream as he tried to get over the thought of the blood,
until it came time to give the Baby His name. As Joseph held the

45

Child, Raziel recited the traditional blessing and Elric’s attention
again focused on the ceremony itself.
“Our God and God of our fathers, preserve this child for his
father and mother, and his name in Israel shall be called Jesus, the son
of . . . ” Raziel stopped.
All eyes turned toward him. What is he going to say? In earthly
terms, they would all expect him to say “Joseph.” But Joseph wasn’t
truly the father. The question was whether Raziel believed that, and
would he be willing to risk speaking the truth?
Raziel looked Joseph square in the eyes and continued. “The Son
of Yahweh. May the Father rejoice in His offspring, and His mother
be glad with the fruit of her womb, as it is written: ‘May your father
and mother rejoice, and she who bore you be glad.’” Raziel continued
on with the rest of the traditional blessing.
Omer and Miriam looked a little puzzled but never did ask
anyone to explain. Mary and Joseph restrained little smiles and
made a connection with their eyes too deep for Omer and Miriam to
understand. Elric and Jenli didn’t bother to subdue their smiles. They
beamed and understood completely.
The remainder of the ceremony continued with all its traditions
and joy. The baby Jesus became quiet again and rested, and a festive
banquet filled the remainder of the day. One of the lambs from the
visiting shepherds had been slaughtered and prepared, and they all
enjoyed an enormous spread of food and wine throughout the day.
Miriam floated about in top form, leaving little opportunity for
others to run away with the conversation.
At the end of the day, Raziel pulled Joseph aside.

“Of course.”
“I would love to see Him grow, but you must, of course, follow

Jenli looked up from his ledger, stopped writing, and shook his

n Persia, the magi convened to review their findings. Nangar
lurked in the shadows.

“Ten days we have searched the archives, and this is all

we have?” Melchior said. A dozen scrolls lay scattered atop a cluttered
table. The faces of the three gray-beards that huddled around the table
flickered in the warm candlelight. “Let’s review them all together and
see if an answer presents itself.”
Balthazar unrolled a scroll and read from it. “‘But One will
come forth in those days whose goings forth are from everlasting to
47

48

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

everlasting. Shout it in Zion, the throne of David shall be His seat
forever.’”
The three nodded. Melchior stroked his beard.
Balthazar said, “This is an excellent prophecy, but it tells us
nothing more than we already know.”
“Agreed,” Melchior said.
Caspar leaned over a scroll and pulled a candle closer. “‘ . . . and
behold the star of the ram, whose coming calls forth the dawning of
a new era.’”
“Again,” Balthazar said, “a new king in Israel.”
“Yes, but it does tie his coming to the appearance of the star,”
Caspar said.
“Here is one,” Melchior said. “‘Weep, o daughters of Zion, rend
your hearts, o sons of Judah, for your King is cut off in darkness.’”
“Yes, yes,” cackled Nangar. “And I will be the one who does the
cutting. Keep searching. Find Him. Take me to Him.”
“This does not seem to fit the other prophecies,” Balthazar said.
“I concur,” Caspar said. “This could refer to almost any of the
ancient kings of Judah.”
“And it gives us no direction,” Melchior said.
“Listen to this one,” Caspar said. “‘Behold the sign, a great star
of the great King. The wise will follow it carefully and see His face.’”
“Then,” responded Balthazar, “we must follow the star to the
King’s location.”
Melchior rubbed his eyebrows and shook his head. “How shall
we do this? We all agree the King is born somewhere in Israel, and
Israel lies to our west. The event we saw was in the eastern sky. From
there all the stars track westward. Therefore, following the trajectory

IN SEARCH OF THE KING

49

of any of the stars would only lead us west, which is something we
already knew. There is no new revelation in this passage.”
Balthazar raised a long bony finger. “But if we track the trajectory
of one of the stars, say Hormoz, we see it disappears behind the
horizon at roughly the same location in the west. We could perhaps
use that point to chart our course.”
“But that location changes by season. What season shall we use
for charting the course? More importantly, the line between where we
are and the spot on the horizon depends upon our current location.
If we were in another country, our charted path would take us to a
different place.”
“We plot it from our location to the point on the horizon that
the star disappears.”
“Why our location?”
“The prophecy speaks to us.”
“From what time?”
“From the time of the conjunction.”
“Which star?”
Nangar spoke into the smoky atmosphere of the Middle Realm.
“It doesn’t matter. Plot your course and leave immediately. We must
go to Israel and find this King.” His words hung like clouds around
the magi, but their spirits didn’t seem to receive them. Nangar threw
up his hands and snarled.
Rather than listening to him, the men had a long intellectual
debate, and, in the end, all agreed that “following the star” meant “go
to Israel” and that they didn’t have any new information to pinpoint
the King’s location. They seemed encouraged, though, that the
prophecy made reference to seeing His face. That meant that if they

50

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

did make the journey, they might expect to have success.
“Go,” Nangar muttered.
Balthazar unrolled another scroll. “Here is one I found today.
‘ . . . at journey’s end, the star alights above the head of the King of
stars. Wise is he who seeks it.’”
“Most intriguing,” Melchior said while stroking his long beard.
“‘At journey’s end.’ To what journey might this refer?”
“It seems to imply the journey of the star,” Caspar said.
“Perhaps,” said Melchior, “but which one? We have three
significant celestials in play right now.”
The three mulled over these thoughts for several minutes.
Balthazar offered his assessment. “I believe we can rule out the moon.
It is not a traveling star like Hormoz and Keyvân. However, irrespective
of the star, what does it mean by ‘journey’? Surely, it cannot mean the
daily journey from east to west. That would imply charting a course
based on its intersection with the horizon, and we have already ruled
this out as a viable interpretation. Besides, we have charted Hormoz
and Keyvân carefully ever since the conjunction, and we have not
observed either of them to ‘alight above’ any location.”
After several more minutes of beard stroking, forehead rubbing,
and foot tapping, Caspar had an idea.
“What if the ‘journey’ refers to something on a longer time scale?
Something like the full journey between positions of opposition. For
Hormoz, that is 399 days.”
“Three hundred seventy-five for Keyvân,” Melchior said.
“This is an interesting theory,” Balthazar said. “Perhaps at the
end of one of these stars’ journey to opposition, we will see another
event that will pinpoint the location. Of course, you realize this

IN SEARCH OF THE KING

51

means waiting another 389 days to see if this interpretation is
correct.”
“Go now!” Nangar shouted. “We can’t wait a year. We need to
find Him now.”
“There is something within me that wants to start our journey
now,” Caspar said. “The sight of those heavenly beings and the
burning I felt within my heart is ever before me. Perhaps we do not
need an exact location.”
“That’s right. That’s right.” Nangar wrung his hands.
“It is a very long journey,” Melchior said. “I think we need to
study further.”
Nangar ground his teeth at his inability to get past the men’s
calculating intellects, and he seethed as they continued to debate.
They all concluded the “journey” probably referred to the passage
from one opposition to the next, and without a precise charted course,
they agreed they would need to continue to wait for something that
provided more direction—even if that meant waiting more than a
year to find it.

Tumur approached the town near Zacharias’s house in Judea two
weeks after the birth of the Son of Man.
It has been six months and still there is no report. The girl Luchek
followed must not have been the one. I’m not surprised. Luchek must have
observed her long enough to realize this and was too proud to return here.
Good.

52

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Tumur snorted a puff of smoke from his nostrils and ambled
through town.
The elzur lieutenant, Lacidar, and his team have the prophet John
hemmed in all about. I’ll never reach him directly. I don’t care. It’s not
him I want. It’s the One he will lead me to. Still, I hate the prophets of
the King. I hate the word they bring. I hate the special favor they have
with the King. I will sow thorns in his path. If it takes twenty years—fifty
years—he will lead me to the prize, and I will make his way hard.
Tumur stepped into the courtyard of the synagogue. No enemy
guards stood by to prevent his access. He approached two rabbis who
talked under the shade of a tree. They discussed the miraculous birth
of John to Zacharias and Elizabeth.
“Miraculous?” Tumur interjected. “I doubt that. Remarkable,
yes. But certainly not miraculous. Mothers and fathers have babies
in their old age all the time. I wonder if Zacharias made up the story
of his vision in the temple to exaggerate the significance of the birth
and to make himself look more pious in your eyes. Think about it. In
your lifetime have you ever witnessed a true miracle or seen a vision
from heaven?”
Tumur breathed on them and watched the thoughts he’d seeded
in the priests’ spirits take root. He turned and entered the synagogue.
He slinked down a hallway and poked his head into the archives.
As expected, there was Zacharias, searching through the scrolls for
messianic references. A warrior of the host stood by him. Three
scribes worked at their tables with scrolls laid out and ink bottles at
arm’s length. Tumur pulled back and waited.
After some time, two scribes exited the archives and walked
down the hall. Tumur edged up behind them and put a hand on

IN SEARCH OF THE KING

each of their shoulders. He positioned his head between them
and whispered, “Who does Zacharias think he is? How could his
son be Elijah? He is shirking his other duties by spending all this
time searching out the Messiah. He thinks he is so much better
than you. His eccentric obsession is going to lead innocent people
astray.”
Tumur chuckled and melted through the wall on his left, into
the private chamber of the chief priest. The priest studied a scroll and
took a sip of water from his goblet. Tumur smiled and sauntered over
to plant more words of division.

Luchek and his team of fifteen demons met in the shadows of a
house in Bethlehem.
“The days of Mary’s purification are almost complete,” Luchek
said in a low raspy tone to his appointed officers. “I expect they will
travel to Jerusalem soon to present Jesus in the temple and offer
sacrifices.”
“Excellent,” said Deagos, a pernicious brute about the same size
as Luchek. His leathery skin looked like the surface of molten lava
with deep ashen-red crags cutting throughout a crusty charcoal black
surface. His bulbous forehead gave the appearance of three–layered
protruding eyebrows which hung so low into his hard–cut face that
they almost concealed the tiny slits of his eyes.
“With them on the move, out in the open,” said Deagos, “they
will be more vulnerable, and we will be able to make our attack.”

54

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Luchek nodded. “Yes. It is an opportune time. We will wait until
we are well clear of Bethlehem and have had the opportunity to assess
the level of enemy protection.”
Restless with anticipation, one of the other officers scratched at
the dirt with the long talons of his bare dragon–like feet. “I shall take
two of our team and prepare the location for the attack.”
“Agreed,” said Luchek with a small puff of sulfurous smoke.
“The rest of us will travel with them while remaining undetected at
a safe distance. If the elzur numbers are small enough and you have
successfully prepared the area, we shall claim our prize, present it to
our lord, and ascend to our rightful place in a new kingdom.”
Deagos gave a humph and snarled. “If . . . this truly is the
Promised One.”
“Still you are not convinced?”
“I am less convinced now than ever. We all saw the child when
Joseph finished the repairs and they moved into the room at the inn.
There were no signs of deity. He looked like a typical human.”
“He was mostly wrapped in a blanket!”
“We should be able to see the glory of His spirit.”
“I’ve told you, it is impossible for human flesh to survive the
glory of the King. He obviously has veiled His spirit.”
“No cherubim.”
“We have been through all this. He is the one. I know it.”
“We shall see.”

ROAD TO JERUSALEM

T

he clouds hung low from horizon to horizon, and the air felt still
and foreboding as Joseph and Mary began their trip northward
to Jerusalem. The trip wouldn’t be a long one, two hours at the

most, but Joseph set Mary and Jesus up on the cart behind their donkey
along with provisions for several days. The dusty road was worn and welltraveled, but a sense of dread hung in the air that couldn’t be explained
by the sullen clouds.

After leaving the outskirts of town, Mary called out to Joseph,
who walked in front of the donkey. “Joseph, I have a bad feeling
about this.”
55

56

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Joseph rubbed the back of his neck and looked up and down the
trail. His eyes darted from horizon to horizon.
“You are worried about what might happen when we get to the
temple,” he called over his shoulder. “We’ve talked about this. It will
be fine.”
“You know it could happen, don’t you?” Mary said.
Joseph stopped the donkey and shuffled back to the cart, the
dust rising and gathering around his leather sandals. As he walked, he
rehearsed the significance of this trip.
The purpose of this trip was to dedicate Jesus in the temple,
offer the required sacrifices, and perform the Pidyon Ha’Ben, the
“redemption of the first–born son.” Originally, from the ancient
Scriptures it was the King’s intent that every first–born Jewish male
serve as a Kohen, that family’s representative in the temple. But after
the Israelites’ sin with the golden calf at Mount Sinai, that privilege
was forfeited by all the tribes except for the tribe of Levi, who alone
had stood with Moses. Since all the non-Levite firstborns were
technically still holy to the Lord but could not serve as Kohen, these
firstborns had to be “redeemed” for the price of five silver shekels
to permit them to be released from their bond. Mary and Joseph
were not descendants of Levi, so in accordance with the requirements
of the law, they were prepared to redeem their firstborn. However,
considering who their firstborn was, they weren’t sure what would
happen when they got to the temple.
Mary said, “We are going to get there; one of the priests is going
to prophesy about who Jesus is; they will bring Him to the high
priest; and not only will we not be able to redeem him, but they will
take Him away to be raised in the temple.”

ROAD TO JERUSALEM

57

“You don’t know that,” Joseph said.
“It happened to Samuel in the Scriptures. His mother Hannah
had to leave him at the temple, and we have Jesus, who is greater than
Samuel. It only makes sense.”
“Yes, but remember Hannah had made that vow before Samuel
was even conceived. You made no such vow.” Joseph paused for a
moment and then proceeded in a slower, more contemplative tone.
“Besides, even if it does happen, it would probably be for the best. He
would receive the finest education. He would be well cared for. And
look at us—I don’t have a regular job and we have no home—He
deserves a better start than we can offer.”
Mary dipped her head and hid the tears welling up.
Joseph touched her on the cheek and wiped away a tear with his
thumb. “Mary, we have already been given a great gift. No matter what
happens when we get to Jerusalem, you will always be remembered as
the mother of the Messiah. No one will ever be able to take that away
from you.” He chuckled. “Maybe even someday you will be written
about in books. And I don’t think we are going to have to leave Him
at the temple.”
Mary forced a smile.
“Mary, we need to settle this in our hearts before we get there. If
the Lord requires us to leave Him to be raised in the temple, are you
going to be able to do it?”
Mary’s well of tears became flowing rivers that cut valleys
through the dust on her face. She held her precious bundle close and
rocked Him, staring into His sparkling eyes. She rocked for a long
time without saying a word.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

58

She shook her head slowly and said with a cracking voice, “Yes.
Yes, I will do whatever the Lord requires.” With a sad smile she added,
“But I do hope He does not require it.”
Even though a tiny glow of peace sparked within their hearts
from having made their resolution, there still remained an uneasiness
about their journey. Joseph tried to convince himself that it was only
the anticipation of what might happen at the temple, but he couldn’t
shake the feeling they were being watched. He kept scanning the
roadside and the surrounding hills as they continued, but he didn’t
see anything unusual.
***
Luchek’s team scurried low like scorpions across the stretches of
flat desert and took up hidden positions behind small mounds and
rocky hills. They grouped into small pockets on the left and right
and stretched out in front and behind. Several tracked from above,
masked within the murky layer of clouds. Luchek had a simple and
direct plan—on his signal, half his forces would engage any visible
escorts while the other half would defend against any enemy that
might appear from outside their perimeter. Meanwhile, he himself
would make the assault on the Child.
They reached the place where his scouts had been waiting and
preparing, and Luchek slinked up beside his officer.
“I commend you for your astute work. This location is perfect.
The hills on each side of the road form an excellent trap. How about
enemy forces? Any sign of the elzurim?”

ROAD TO JERUSALEM

59

“No. My scouts have been patrolling this entire corridor all
last night and today, and there are no enemy warriors present. Also,
we have been preparing the battlefield—speaking blindness and
confusion into the air all around this region. If any enemy does show
up, he will be lost in a fog of darkness.”
“Well done. I will remember your initiative when we ascend to
our places of power after this battle.”
“Look at them,” Deagos said with a sneer. “The only escort for
the ‘King’ is a captain and a lieutenant? They are either mocking our
power or this is not the King as you suppose.” He drew his jagged
black sword and moved from their hiding spot behind the hill toward
the approaching travelers.
Luchek dug his talons into the bulging forearm of Deagos. “Or,”
he snarled, “it is as I have said from the beginning. This is the King
in human flesh. And his warriors are purposely trying to not draw
attention to his location in an effort to keep Him hidden. They could
not be mocking us because they do not even know we are here. Be
patient a little while longer. We will have our prize.”
Deagos yanked his arm free. “I am tired of waiting. You disgust
me. You used to be an agent of action. Now look at you, being
‘patient.’ You keep being patient. If that is the King, He is going to
feel my blade today.”
“No!”
Deagos unfurled his wings and shot straight up. He looped high
enough for his bat-like wings to cut into the bottom of the cloud deck
and then accelerated downward toward the unsuspecting travelers
from behind. The remainder of Luchek’s team turned to Luchek.
He motioned for them to stay low and wait. This wasn’t the way he

60

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

intended for the battle to proceed; however, this brash move might
play to their advantage by revealing the enemy’s weaknesses or by
drawing out any hidden forces lying in wait. With gritty anticipation,
Luchek waited and watched.
The captain, Elric, walked in the very front. Following him, the
man led a donkey which pulled a cart. On the cart rode the young
mother and the One for whom they had come. Behind them all
marched a lieutenant of the host. Both of the elzur escorts had their
swords sheathed, oblivious to the onslaught about to be unleashed
upon them.
Deagos is wise to attack from behind, for the angelic escorts are
both looking forward and unaware of anything coming from behind. It
should prove effortless to cut through the lone lieutenant and reach the
Child before the captain even knows what hit them. Luchek didn’t have
to wait long for the initial clash. Deagos streaked toward the Child
at a blurring speed with his sword outstretched, piercing through the
unsuspecting stillness.
What happened next was too quick to fathom, even for the
spiritual eyes that saw it. Without ever turning around, the lieutenant
drew his sword. It became engulfed in an intense blue flame and
made two powerful arcing circles at the speed of lightning. With
precise timing, the first arc of his blade intercepted Deagos’s thrusting
sword in mid-flight and shattered it into shards at the exact instant
that Deagos reached his position. With a continuous uninterrupted
motion, the second circle of the lieutenant’s blade cut Deagos in two
and left nothing but a cloud of yellow smoke. Then with a third less
vigorous swing, the lieutenant’s sword gave up the blue flame and
returned to its sheath, still glowing hot.

ROAD TO JERUSALEM

61

The lieutenant continued walking as though nothing had
happened, although he did take a moment to turn his head each way
and scan the horizon for any other would–be attackers. The entire
engagement finished in less than a blink of an eye. The captain never
even looked back. He opened his wings and shook them the way
a hawk might flutter his wings to fling off unwanted dust. Joseph
and the donkey continued plodding along while Mary and the Baby
rocked in the back of the cart.
The officer next to Luchek looked up and waited. Luchek
stumbled backward two steps and sank to his knees. Within moments
the rest of his team gathered around.
“The flame of vengeance,” one of the demons said. “You didn’t
tell us they would carry the flame of vengeance.”
“And his sword wasn’t destroyed,” said another. “They must have
special weapons.”
Luchek rubbed his good eye with the back of his fist. “I don’t
understand. I fought with the captain, and he never—”
“I’m not going down there for a frontal attack,” another demon
said.
“I won’t either,” said another. “We may outnumber them
seven to one, but that is of little consequence if we face the flame of
vengeance.”
“I’m out.”
“I’m not going.”
“No.”
“No.”
“I agree,” Luchek growled. “We need another strategy.” He
shoved his sword into its sheath and crossed his arms. “Is there any

62

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

more doubt about my claim about the Child? I think this display is
proof enough.”
The team members all looked around at each other and nodded
their heads.
“This is the child King, and we will destroy him. But we will wait
for another time. I will continue to bolster our numbers and devise
a new plan of attack. You continue to hold our perimeter and keep
unwanted rivals out. When the time is right, we will claim our prize.”

“Look at the size of these stones,” Daniel said. He ran
his hand along the outer wall of the temple.
Levi slid his hand over the flat face of the wall and traced the
straight edge of a seam with his finger. “Every one was cut in the
quarries and set in place here.”
“This wall is wide enough to drive a chariot along the top,”
Daniel said.
Levi craned his neck upward. “If you could get one up there.”

They both laughed.
Levi put his hand on Daniel’s shoulder. “Prepare yourself to
be amazed. You have never seen anything like what you’re about to
see. You were here when you were younger, but you probably don’t
remember. I’m glad Father decided to come and see it since we were
so close.”
They passed through the outer gate and entered a large open
courtyard. Jeremiah and Jesse stopped, and Jeremiah called back to
Levi and Daniel.
“Jesse and I are going ahead into the Court of the Israelites to
worship. Levi—you stay out here with Daniel and show him around.”
“I don’t need anyone to watch over me,” Daniel called back.
“It is for the best. Do as I say.”
“Yes, Father,” Levi answered.
Levi pulled Daniel to the side, out of the mainstream of the
outer gate. “Look around,” Levi said, motioning with his arm. “This
is called the Court of the Gentiles.”
Grand colonnades with hundreds of stately marble columns
supporting the porticos lined the outer courtyard area. Daniel’s mouth
hung wide open and his eyes darted everywhere. “It’s amazing.”
“This is a sacred place built on sacred ground. Solomon’s temple
stood right here in ancient times. It was rebuilt after the exile, but
Herod came in and expanded the temple grounds and built up
everything you see here. He did it to buy the favor of our people, but
I’m glad to have such a majestic place to worship and perform our
religious duties.”
“It’s amazing. Everything is so tall. And huge.”
“This outer court is the only place non-Jews are allowed.”

THE TEMPLE

65

Daniel’s attention turned inward toward the bustling crowds of
people. Rows of vendors stretched in each direction, and the colors
and sounds swirled around in continuous motion. The mixture of
smells—sheep, bread, perfume, sweat, incense, roasting meat—
created a disjointed stew of emotions. It was as though they had
stepped onto a fast–moving cart, racing through an atmosphere full
of energy. Over in the corner, under the shade of the colonnade, sat
a rabbi teaching a small group of interested pupils. A choir of skilled
Levite singers lifted hallowed harmonies above the shouts of vendors
to would–be buyers while doves and pigeons flapped and cooed inside
small wooden cages. A handful of foreigners milled about, admiring
the architecture and pointing out artistic features to each other while
devout worshipers stood, knelt, and paced, offering up prayers to an
unseen God. Hundreds and hundreds of people filled the courtyard,
each one going about their own business.
“What are all these people doing?” Daniel said.
“Some are worshipers on pilgrimages. There are foreigners on
tours. Of course, all the women and children. Do you see all the
priests in the white linen robes and tubular hats? They help direct
traffic and advise worshipers about the kinds of sacrifices needed
and where to go. See those rows of tables over there? Those are the
money changers. The temple has its own currency, and those men will
exchange people’s regular money for temple money. The vendors over
there sell animals used in the ritual sacrifices. There are vendors who
sell food. Vendors who sell souvenirs.”
“Doesn’t all this seem like a business?”
“It takes many people to keep everything running. But remember,
this is only the outer court. The temple areas become increasing holy

as you move from east to west into the inner courts. Behind that big
stone wall is the Court of the Women, where both Jewish men and
women are allowed. In this court, there is always dancing, singing,
and worshipful music. Beyond this is the Court of the Israelites,
where only the Jewish men can enter. The very inner court is the
Court of the Priests, and it’s there the sacrifices are offered. Father
can’t even go in there. Finally, there is the temple itself.”
The radiant white marble of the temple soared above the rest of
the complex. Stark. Majestic. Unapproachable.
Daniel looked at the bustle of the outer courtyard. He looked up
at the temple. He looked back at the crowds.
“What’s the real purpose of all this? All these people running
around. They’ll never be able to get up there. It’s like God is trying to
keep us away.”
“The Lord is holy.”
“I suppose. I keep thinking about the angels I saw in the sky. And
those men who convinced Father there aren’t any spiritual beings. No
life after this. It makes all this seem useless.” He stared at the temple.
“I feel like there’s something more. Like there’s a whole other world.
I don’t know. I don’t understand.”
***
The mighty senturim stood guard in the Middle Realm around
the temple grounds, with one senturi stationed at each corner of the
outer wall. The human-like forms of these angels towered fifty feet
tall, and they had four wings like the cherubim, although they rarely
used them. Their primary station was to stand guard over sacred or

THE TEMPLE

67

strategic places on earth. They carried flaming broadswords that were
always ablaze with pure white flames, and the huge blades were so
substantial that even the mightiest of the elzurim could not wield
them. Though not as powerful as the cherubim, the senturim could
certainly defend any earthly location against any beaelzurim, and
they were a most formidable presence at the temple gate.
Accompanying Joseph, Mary, and Jesus, Elric and Jenli started
up the path leading to the temple steps. The senturi at the southern
temple wall dropped to his knee, bowed his head low, and laid his
sword in front of him with open hands. Elric muttered, “No,
no, no,” and shot forward toward the senturi. He reached him in a
single wing beat.
“Stand up! Stand up!” Elric said. “In the name of the King, stand
up and hear my word.”
The senturi stood, but kept his gaze fixed on the young couple
approaching the temple grounds accompanied by an angelic
lieutenant. “But that is—”
“Do not speak it,” Elric said. “Please, look at me.”
The senturi turned toward Elric.
Elric felt dwarfed by the senturi—his own entire frame no larger
than one of the senturi’s legs. He lifted off and hovered near the
senturi’s ear. “Thank you, I will explain,” Elric said.
Elric kept his voice low enough for only the senturi to hear.
“Our mission is to keep the King hidden until the appointed time.
Please do not do anything to draw attention to Him. We must enter
here today to fulfill the requirements of the law, but His risk of
exposure is extreme. We must not allow any enemy to escape who
has knowledge of who He is. Therefore, allow no beaelzurim to enter

68

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

until we depart, and watch closely all those who are already within
the walls. If circumstances require it, you are authorized to send any
of them to the abyss.”
The giant pillar of power nodded. “Fortress of the King,” he said
with a low rumble.
Elric continued, “By your leave, I must deliver these orders to
the other guards.”
The senturi nodded, and in a blink Elric visited the other three
outer wall guards. Like a hummingbird darting from one blossom to
the next, Elric moved to the inner court where he gave word to two
more senturim who stood at the entrance of the temple. From their
position they could survey the entire Court of the Priests as well as
the outer court. They would be critical to the success of this mission.
Elric briefed them, and by the time he returned to the outer court
gate, Joseph and Mary had climbed all the steps up the temple mount
and prepared to pass through the southern gate of the thick stone
outer wall.
They entered wide eyed, flanked by Elric on the right and by
Jenli on the left. With the one–month–old Jesus wrapped in the
blanket Elric had left in the Bethlehem stable, they passed under the
portico and then past the ranks of marble columns.
The Middle Realm in the Court of the Gentiles had as much

of doctrine of which neither side had correct understanding. Several
dozen beaelzurim worked their evil plots within the outer court walls,
and an equal number of angels with their own assignments performed
their duties. With so many opposing spirits in such close proximity,
the palpable friction charged the air, but each spirit kept to his own
sphere of authority.
Jenli’s team, who each stole in without raising any attention
from the preoccupied enemy forces, mingled amongst the crowds.
None of Luchek’s team made it past the senturim, even though each
made an earnest attempt. They retreated, hid outside the walls,
and waited for their prize to re-emerge.

lric and Jenli continued into the temple grounds with Joseph
and Mary, who held Jesus close in her arms. Elric scanned the
crowd for both enemy forces and suspicious humans.

Across the court, one of Jenli’s team gave a nod. “My team is in
place and all is clear so far,” Jenli said to Elric without turning his head.
Elric kept scanning. “With this many people and so many
enemies in open contact, this is by far the most dangerous operation
we have faced. Extra vigilance.”
They weaved their way into the open courtyard. Elric stopped
cold. That man over there. The Holy Spirit glowed all around the

man, and he had a full suit of spiritual armor. Although deep in
prayer, he kept looking over at Mary and the Baby. Elric motioned
to Jenli. Jenli nodded. The man focused an intent, persistent gaze at
Mary with a knowing, insightful look.
Elric whispered, “He looks like he might have a revelation
about . . . ” Elric paused. “He’s headed this way! Have your team
form a buffer zone around us. The Spirit of the Lord is heavy upon
this man, and we cannot let enemy ears hear anything he might say.
Also, prepare two of your warriors to intervene and break up the
conversation on my cue.”
In an instant Jenli disappeared, and an inconspicuous circle of
angels formed.
Joseph and Mary exchanged startled glances when a stranger
approached them from across the courtyard as though he knew them.
He appeared unthreatening, being somewhat frail with long years
etched on his face and beard. His eyes twinkled with joy, and his
trembling hands showed his excitement about something. He walked
up to Mary and stared at Jesus.
“It is true!” his voice crackled. “It’s Him! Praise be to the God of
our Fathers; my eyes have seen Him!”
Joseph and Mary exchanged glances again.
Elric glanced all around. No enemy close enough to hear.
“I’m sorry,” the man said, “I have startled you. Please let me
explain. My name is Simeon, and I have been praying for the
consolation of Israel my whole life. Years ago the Lord told me that
I would not see death before my eyes had seen the Lord’s Christ.
My remaining years are few, and I wondered if I would ever see the
fulfillment of that promise. Today, I was praying in the Spirit, and

when I saw you, He revealed to me that this little one is the Promised
One. You know this, do you not?”
Joseph put his arm around Mary. “Yes, well we—”
“I know this may seem forward, but please, may I hold Him?”
Mary flashed an apprehensive look to Joseph, who gave Mary a
shrug and a nod.
Elric’s hand moved to his sword handle.
Simeon took Him into his arms as though he held the greatest
treasure imaginable, stared down into His face, and said, “Now, Lord,
You are letting Your bond-servant depart in peace, according to Your
word; for my eyes have seen Your salvation, which You have prepared
in the presence of all the peoples: a light for revelation to the Gentiles,
and the glory of Your people Israel.”
He blinked through a flood of tears and held Jesus for what
seemed like a long time. Finally, he handed Him back to Mary and
blessed the young couple.
With a quiet and earnest tone, he spoke to Mary. “Behold, this
Child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and as a sign
to be opposed—and a sword will pierce your own soul—to the end
that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.”
Time to cut this meeting short. Elric gave Jenli the sign. Jenli
lifted his left arm, and two priests in white linen robes approached
Joseph, Mary, and Simeon from behind.
One of the priests tapped Joseph on the shoulder. “Sir, it appears
you are here to dedicate your son and offer a sacrifice. Come, let me
show you where you can purchase a pair of turtledoves. Do you have
the five shekels required for the Pidyon Ha’Ben, or do we need to visit
a money exchanger?” Before Joseph could answer, the priest led him
and Mary off to one of the vendors to their left.

73

At the same time, the second priest put his arm around Simeon’s
shoulder and turned him toward the right. “Sir, is there something I
can help you find this morning?”
“No,” rattled Simeon. “I’ve already found Him. That was the
Messiah! I saw Him!”
“Yes, I understand. We should let that nice young couple tend
to their business. My name is Jennidab. May I buy you something to
eat? You look hungry.”
“That was Him!” he said, looking back toward Jesus. “The Lord
revealed to me that He was the Christ—I have been praying for this
my whole life.”
Jennidab turned Simeon away with his hands on his shoulders.
“You have been given a great gift. Blessed is the man who sees the
salvation of the Lord. But it is not yet the hour for Him to be revealed
to the world. Come, let me get you something to eat.” He dropped
several coins on the table of a food vendor and said, “My friend here
is hungry. This should cover his meal. Thank you.”
One of the coins rolled off the table and fell to the ground. Both
the vendor and Simeon looked down. Simeon retrieved the coin.
They looked back up, and the priest had disappeared. Jennidab, now
unseen to the Physical Realm, stood beside the perplexed Simeon and
smiled. He reached forward and touched Simeon’s eyes. “See Him
not,” he said.
Simeon turned back toward Joseph and Mary, his anxious eyes
searching everywhere.
Joseph finished purchasing a pair of turtledoves, and he turned
toward the priest. “Thank you for . . . ” He looked at Mary. “Where
did he go?”

Mary shrugged.
“The priests are always so helpful here,” Joseph said.
They headed toward the fourteen steps leading up to the
Beautiful Gate into the Court of the Women.
“I was beginning to get worried,” Mary said. “I knew someone
would prophesy over him, and I was right. What if he had told one of
those priests and they brought Him to the high priest?”
Joseph stopped walking and took Mary’s hand. “But he didn’t.
I told you, I do not believe it is God’s will to leave Jesus to be raised
in the temple. We should not let that be a worry. It was amazing,
though, hearing another confirmation, was it not?”
Mary nodded but kept a nervous eye toward everyone.
Elric smiled and also continued examining the crowd. He
whispered to Jenli as they walked, “There should be less chance for
entanglements with enemy forces in the inner courts, but we must
also avoid revealing the King to the priests now. The time is not right.”
Jenli whispered back, “If there are any more prophets present
who truly know the word of the Lord, it will not be possible to keep
them silent.”
“Keep your team close.”
Up fifteen more steps to the porch leading to the Gate of Nicanor,
beyond which lay the Court of the Israelites and the Court of the
Priests, Joseph and Mary presented their sacrifice and completed all
the requirements of the law. They offered dedication prayers, and the
priest holding Jesus completed the ceremony for the Pidyon Ha’Ben.
He handed Jesus back to Mary.
“The Messiah!” a woman shouted.

DEDICATION

75

Elric spun around and pulled his sword. An old woman pointed
at Jesus from across the court.
“Anna,” Jenli said. “A prophetess of the tribe of Asher. Widowed
sixty years ago, she never leaves the temple, serving day and night
with fastings and prayers. I should have known she would—”
“Praise God, the Messiah has come!” Anna yelled. “Look
everyone, it is He!” She pushed against the crowd toward the place
where Joseph and Mary stood. “The redeemer of Jerusalem. This is
the One. This is . . . ”
Every demon eye in the Court of the Israelites drilled in on Jesus.
Elric swallowed hard. Oh, no! He gritted his teeth.
At least fifty demon swords rang out as their blades slid from
their sheaths. With a roar, they all exploded inward. Like a flash of
lightning, Jenli’s team formed a tight circle around Jesus. Elric leapt
in front of the ring. A wall of demonic steel, frenzied red eyes, and
bared teeth closed in. Smash! With his left hand, Elric blocked the
blow of one demon; with his right, he thrust his sword through the
chest of another. He spun, clipped the leg of the attacker on the left,
and cut down two more with a horizontal power slice. The wounded
attacker on the left dropped to one knee. Elric finished his spin and
drove his sword through the demon’s back, who collapsed amid a
cloud of sulfur. Elric smashed the face of an attacker with his shield,
sending him faltering backward. A slash, a thrust, a spinning slice.
Four more demons fell. A wounded beaelzurim at his feet regained
enough strength to rise to his hands and knees and grope for his
sword. Elric pierced him through again. He wedged his foot under
the incapacitated demon and, with a lifting kick, flung him into three

more attackers. A thrust to the left. A quick glance to the right. Jenli
was spinning, hacking, pounding back the enemy.
A demon leapt over Elric’s head toward the inner circle. Elric
shot up his left hand and snagged his ankle. A defender from behind
drove his blade through the demon’s neck, and Elric hurled him
back over the heads of the incoming forces. Leaving a trail of yellow
smoke, the demon landed in mid-court—a court embroiled in chaos.
More demons rushed in from the outer courts. The other angels in
the temple had joined the fight. All across the court, steel crashed and
sparks burned through the Middle Realm. Most of the combatants
didn’t know what they were fighting for, but the furor of every
engagement burned hot.
Elric brought his blade straight down and rent an attacker from
top to bottom. He blocked an incoming fireball with his shield.
“They are gaining in strength and numbers!” he called out to
Jenli.
“I don’t know how much longer we can hold out,” Jenli shouted
back. “Why are we not granted the flame of vengeance?”
Elric leapt to avoid a waist–level swing. He flipped, blocked a
fireball, and landed behind the attacker. He thrust his blade through
the attacker’s chest and withdrew it in a wide arc, cutting down two
more assailants. Why indeed? He glanced quickly at Joseph, Mary, and
Jesus. Unharmed, but dangerously vulnerable. These beaelzurim aren’t
our only problem. If the priests get their hands on the King . . . I need to
get Him out of here. I wonder what is happening in the Physical Realm.
The Physical Realm churned with growing chaos, shadowing
the struggle in the Middle Realm. The crowds stirred, and stories
flew around about something happening in the inner court. In the

77

excitement, the message became twisted as it passed from one group
of people to the next. By the time news made it out to the edges
of the Court of the Gentiles, people relayed different messages: “the
Messiah has come to deliver Jerusalem,” or, “the high priest is calling
on all Jerusalem to revolt against Rome,” or, “a Roman soldier has
murdered the high priest,” or some other combination of these ideas.
The priests, including the one who had dedicated Jesus, shouted over
the clamor for the people to remain calm. The last thing they needed
were Roman soldiers storming in to quell a full–scale riot.
Elric blocked a sword strike and answered with a disabling thrust.
He looked back toward the two temple senturim who remained
motionless. What are they waiting for? Why don’t they—
“Aughhh!” Jenli’s voice rose above the noise.
Oh, no! Jenli! One demon pinned Jenli to the ground with his
sword through Jenli’s chest. Two other demons catapulted over him
and pounded one of Jenli’s warriors with rapid, repeated blows. The
warrior blocked the blows with his shield, staggering backward with
each strike. A third attacker launched over all of them on a direct
trajectory toward the King.
“No!” Elric shouted. He leapt toward him but stopped in midlunge. Some vile creature had a hold of his leg.
The attacker frothed at the mouth and dove toward Jesus with
his wicked sword held high. His massive arm muscles tensed in
preparation for a powerful downstroke. With a haunting squeal, he
swung his blade toward the King.
Shhhh-boom! An immense ball of scintillating white fire blasted
the demon on his chest, sending him careening backward until he
disappeared in a flash of white light followed by a pale, yellow vapor.

78

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

The senturim at the inner court! They have joined the fight!
The once motionless statues of restraint now demonstrated
their power, and they moved even faster than the elzurim. With
their flaming broadswords outstretched at their foes, they spoke a
single word, “kaleesh,” which in their tongue meant “righteous in
judgment.” The energy from that word flashed like the explosion of a
star, traveled down their arms, through their swords, and out the tip
toward their targets. The intense ball of energy sizzled the spiritual air
as it traveled to its mark. In an instant, less time than it took Elric to
complete a swing of his sword, the two senturim vanquished five of
the attackers within the inner court.
The other four senturim leapt over the outer walls with a
single unfolding of their wings. They each used a blast of fireballs to
announce their arrival into the fray, but after that they imposed their
huge swords directly onto the heads of the enemy. Unlike the elzurim,
there was no thrust-and-parry, give-and-take when a senturim swung
his sword. They simply lowered the flat side of the blade down on the
head of the enemy faster than the enemy could respond and pressed
the demon into a puff of yellow smoke. The elzurim had never seen
one of the senturim use the sharp edge of his sword, and there were
only wild imaginings about the kind of devastation that could be
carved by that edge. In less than five seconds, the senturim cleansed
the house of enemy forces. The Middle Realm fell silent.
The senturim returned to their posts without a word. The
elzurim stood dazed. The wounded regained their strength and rose
to their feet.
The crowds of people, still in confusion, milled around.
The initial excitement died down, and it appeared the priests had
prevented a riot.

This is our opportunity to get the King out, but even with all the
confusion and pushing, there will be people who might see the King and
recognize Him. He spotted Anna, still looking for the Messiah. He
spotted Simeon wading through the crowd. I can’t take the chance.
This calls for drastic measures.
Elric held his sword out horizontal to the ground and spoke
the word, “blindness to the King.” Without a sound, a horizontal
blue disc of light exploded outward and expanded like a circular wave
in a pool of water until it reached every person within the temple
complex. Now I need to get Joseph to move.
“Joseph, it’s time to go,” Elric said. “Take the Child and leave the
temple now. You have fulfilled the requirements of the law. Now you
need to leave. Do it quickly.”
Joseph turned to Mary, who watched all the surrounding
commotion with a confused expression. “Mary, I think we should
leave. I don’t know why, but I sense we should not tarry here any
longer.”
“I agree,” she said with a quick response.
Elric pulled Jenli in close. “You and your team explain to these
other warriors what happened. Then meet us outside. I’m taking the
King out.”
Joseph and Mary pressed their way out to the outer courtyard.
They passed hundreds of people, all straining toward the inner court.
The people bumped and shoved and shouted a dozen different things
they heard about something they thought had happened.
“They are all looking past us as though we’re not even here,”
Joseph called back to Mary, pushing through the crowd. “There’s the
outer gate. We’re almost there. Are you all right?”

“Yes, fine,” Mary called back, holding Jesus close.
They kept a quick pace until they jostled all the way out of
the temple grounds. They scampered down the steps to where their
donkey was tied.
They stopped and looked at each other, breathing hard. Joseph
panted a nervous laugh. “What just happened?”

hree days after visiting the temple, Joseph shuffled into their
rented room in Jerusalem and slumped onto the stool by the door
to wash his feet. He looked haggard and discouraged.

“Still nothing?” Mary said.
“It’s strange,” Joseph answered as he swabbed his foot with the
sponge, “it’s as though every door is closed. Nobody in Jerusalem
needs the services of a carpenter. I can’t even find any small temporary
jobs.”
He wrung out the sponge and started on the other foot. “Actually,
that’s not completely true—there are plenty of opportunities for

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

work if I wanted to be a part of one of Herod’s big construction
projects. He has dozens of them going on, here in Jerusalem and all
over the country. But I can’t see doing that kind of work. Supporting
any project of his seems . . . wrong. I do not want to have to do that.”
“I agree,” Mary said. “We will find something else.”
“But what? And when?” Joseph said. “We can’t stay here like this
much longer. The cost of a room here in Jerusalem is much higher
than in Bethlehem, and we only brought provisions for a few days.”
Elric watched the emotional edges unravel the way they always
seemed to do with humans under situations like this. He whispered
to Jenli, “If only they could see how much work your team has done
to close all those doors.”
“Not only my team,” Jenli said. “The King has hundreds of
individual seemingly unrelated circumstances all throughout the city
working together to drive them back to Bethlehem. Even I have to
marvel at the intricate details for which we only know a small part.”
Elric’s eyes sparkled. “The ways of the King are infinitely more
meaningful and interesting than we can ever imagine, and they are
always intended to lead man to a deeper relationship with Him. I do
love being a part of the play, even when it means watching these poor
humans scratch their way through. All we can do is help mold the
circumstances and reinforce the things the King is already speaking
to Joseph’s heart.”
“I sense it’s time for some additional nudging,” Jenli said. Elric
nodded.
“The Lord does not want you to stay here. It is time to return
to Bethlehem.” Elric spoke the words into the air so both Joseph
and Mary could hear. The words rolled up into tiny spheres of light

and penetrated into their spirits. He waited to see if the seeds took
root.
The two humans continued pondering their circumstances for
a while longer, trying to figure out what they should do, and the
discussion simmered all throughout dinner. The Baby slept, and the
flickering glow of the lamp cast a rosy warm glow on His puffy little
cheeks.
“It’s strange,” Joseph said. “In my mind, it makes the most sense
for us to be here in Jerusalem. The temple is here. The palace is here.
This is the seat of power and the place we know Jesus is going to rule
from. I don’t know when or how it is going to happen, but at some
point, Jesus is going to have to take his place in the royal palace. It
all makes sense in my head, but for some reason my heart is telling
me something else—like we are not supposed to stay here. But still,
I am having a hard time letting go of Jerusalem. Am I crazy? Maybe
we should give it a few more days. Maybe I should take a job as one
of Herod’s laborers so we can settle here.”
“Maybe you should follow your heart,” Mary said. “I can’t
explain it, but something inside also tells me we don’t belong here. At
least not now. What if the reason you have not found anything is that
the Lord is trying to guide us to another place?”
“I don’t know. I suppose.”
“I have to admit,” continued Mary, “I am a little surprised about
how things are turning out. I was sure I was going to have to watch
Him grow up in the temple—and I do think I was ready for that.
But now, I have a feeling we should go back to Bethlehem—and
not because I’m afraid of losing Him to the priests. Bethlehem feels
right.”

“I feel it, too,” said Joseph. “Have you had any dreams?”
“No, have you?”
“No. Sometimes I wish the Lord would tell us directly what we
are supposed to do.” He paused a moment. “Maybe we should sleep
on it. Perhaps He will give one of us a dream tonight. Hopefully,
things will be clearer tomorrow morning.”
Elric smiled. There would be no dreams tonight.
***

Joseph and Mary slept well—deep and dreamless. But the
morning light did bring the unspoken clarity they hoped for. After
only a short discussion, both Joseph and Mary knew they should
return to Bethlehem for now.
They finished the morning meal, loaded the cart, and headed
southward. Mary wrapped the Baby in His blanket, and He looked
as human as usual. A captain and lieutenant of the host provided a
conspicuously inconspicuous escort while a silent shadow surrounded
them at a safe distance.
Two hours later, after an easy and uneventful trip, they knocked
at the door of Omer and Miriam, who appeared more than happy to
see the young couple back.
“I don’t understand it,” Omer said. “Even though we still have
booming traffic from the census, your old room is still open and
available for you. You can move back in right now. And, I have leads
on some potential jobs for you.”

After moving into their room, stowing the cart, and tending to
the donkey, Joseph went straight out to see about work. He returned
a few hours later shaking his head and smiling with amazement.
“I guess we are meant to be here,” Joseph said. “I have found
enough work to keep busy for a year!”

Six months after returning to Bethlehem, Elric squatted low
next to Mary on the floor and shook his head. He wiped the corner
of each eye with the back of his hand.
“What is it?” Jenli said.
“I . . . still struggle to comprehend.”
Mary helped Jesus push up and stand on His chubby little legs
and doughball feet, His tiny hands wrapped around her index fingers.
Elric continued. “He spoke the universe into existence. And
now this young girl teaches Him to stand.” He shook his head again.
Jenli rubbed the stubble on his cheek and jaw.
Elric stood and walked to the other side of the room. Jenli
followed.
“What is the condition around our periphery?” Elric said.
“Luchek’s numbers continue to grow.”
“Are they keeping their distance?”
“Yes, after the attack on the road to Jerusalem, they are all very
cautious. They are doing an excellent job, however, at keeping all
other enemy from getting close.
Elric nodded. “Good.”

“And, whenever Mary takes Jesus to the marketplace, He always
wants to be draped in and holding onto His blanket. In fact, He does
that whenever they are outside the house.”
Elric smiled and looked back at Jesus who bounced up and down
and babbled like a happy child.
“It is only a matter of time before Luchek believes he has
sufficient numbers—or his team becomes impatient,” Jenli said.
“Either way, we are in for a difficult fight, and the timing will
be critical.”
“Zaben’s plan did not include this additional complication.”
Elric rubbed his chin and raised his eyebrows. “No. No it didn’t.”

he relentless midday sun roosted over the burnt–out rubble of
Rachael’s old family home in Egypt. Timrok surveyed the ten–
mile perimeter around the property from outside the shell of the

house. His team stood guard around the perimeter, enforcing the no–
entry zone he had pronounced over a year before. All was quiet. He
stepped into the roofless remains of his command post and sat on a
spiritual stool he had fashioned for himself.

He formed a small energy ball in his left hand. With his right
hand he drew the energy out into a thick strand. He rolled it between
his fingers, molded it, breathed into it. Moments later he had a tiny
87

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

trumpet, no larger than his thumb, silver and perfect. Timrok held it
by the bell between his fingers and gave it a gentle flick into the air,
where it floated at eye level. He blew on it. It sounded a tiny little
tone, clear and bright, and floated away. Timrok nodded and smiled.
He formed another energy ball for another little trumpet.
From far over the horizon, the sound of a mighty battle wafted
through Timrok’s command post. The muffled roar of thousands of
spiritual combatants rose and fell like ocean waves crashing on a rocky
shore. Timrok looked up in the direction of the sound, looked back
down at the tiny trumpet between his fingers, and gave the trumpet
a flick.
“One,” he said to himself. “In over a year, only one enemy has
strayed into our perimeter.”
He smiled and shrugged. “We did send him to the abyss, though.”
He looked off toward the distant battle and caught a glimpse of
a high–swooping swarm of demons diving onto Zaben’s fortress. He
took a deep breath and released another tiny trumpet.
Timrok had just sent his eighth trumpet into the atmosphere
when a flock of gray doves took off from the northern field. Their
chirping flight caught his attention, and he turned in time to see two
white lights approaching low and fast. Within seconds, two angelic
visitors alighted inside the command post.
Timrok jumped to his feet. “Greetings, my captain,” Timrok
said to Elric. He bowed his head to the commander with Elric. “And
greetings to you, Commander Kai.”
The commander, who was almost twice the size of Elric, nodded
once as Elric said to Timrok, “It’s good to see you, my friend. It has
been a long time.”

89

“A very long time,” Timrok said, looking across his silent,
eventless post.
Elric smiled. “Jesus is ten months old now, and it is time to
prepare for the next stage. I have a new assignment for you.”
Timrok palmed his sword handles. His bright eyes darted back
and forth between the captain and the commander.
“The battle is going well at Zaben’s stronghold,” Elric said. “The
enemy is fully engaged there and is still convinced they have the
Lord trapped within. However, their command center is completely
open—their warriors and messengers are free to come and go at will.
It is time now to cut them off. I need you to take your team and
attack their command center.”
Timrok’s jaw fell slack and his eyes widened. “Sir, the Prince of
Persia is in command there. And I would suspect that Satan himself
has set up a throne to oversee the battle.”
“He has indeed,” Elric said.
“I love a good fight, but, sir, this fight will be short and fruitless.
We are no match for that kind of power.”
“Agreed,” answered Elric. “That is why you are bringing
Commander Kai with you.”
The commander smiled and gritted his teeth. He had the same
kind of dogged spark in his eyes that Timrok himself always had
when facing overwhelming odds.
“And,” continued Elric, “your mission is not to defeat them but to
distract them and prevent any outside communication. Commander
Kai will keep Marr busy while you and your team deal with all the
peripheral warriors and messengers.”

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“And what about Satan?” Timrok fidgeted and his voice cracked.
“He is not a mere beaelzur like the others. A cherub is not one to be
trifled with.”
“He will either stay for the fight or will try to escape. I suspect
he will break away. And there is little you can do to restrain him if he
does. This is fine, as it will divide the leadership. Let him go and seal
in their command center. No word comes in or out.”
“And if he stays to fight?”
“Then I’m afraid it will be a very short engagement.” Elric’s tone
then changed from calm and factual to grave and serious, “Do not
expect to receive power to vanquish any of the enemy in this battle.
Simply pin them down and cut them off.”
Timrok stood tall, raised his chin, and clenched his fists. “Yes,
captain. For the honor of the King we gladly accept this task. Is there
a specific strategy you have in mind for the attack itself?”
Elric smiled, cocked his head, and said, “You . . . just attack.”
Timrok remembered their first conversation a couple of years
before on the cliff in Africa, laughed a deep hearty laugh, and
answered, “In His service.”
“Look,” Elric said. “Your replacements are here.”
Four senturim descended and took up positions at each corner
of the property.
***
Timrok expected to see turmoil over Zaben’s stronghold, but
the spectacle that came into focus as he, his team, and Commander
Kai approached the engagement area was far more expansive than

INTO THE SEAT OF DARKNESS

91

he could have imagined. Not since the Rebellion had he seen a
concentration of demonic warfare this large and this intense. A
boiling black cloud of evil blanketed the Middle Realm for miles,
and it touched everything.
“Heartrending, is it not?” Kai called out to Timrok. He tightened
in their flight formation.
“I had no idea.”
“You have been insulated in your remote post,” Kai said. “In my
command center, the reports have been horrendous. Over the last
ten months there has been a sharp rise in illnesses—everything from
the common cold to blindness, cancer, and leprosy. Strange accidents
which leave people lame and suffering are increasing. Infant mortality
is up. Life expectancy is down. The fertility and health of the herds
and flocks in the region are at an all–time low. Crops are failing from
months of drought. A scourge of snakebites and wild animal attacks
fill people’s hearts with fear and despair.”
“What about the prayers of the righteous? Surely the people
must be calling out to the Lord.”
“In the face of all this calamity, instead of calling for help from
the King, the people have embraced the darkness and help fuel it.
In fact, most of the people blame the Lord for all of it. There are
conflicts all throughout the region. Even gangs of children from
one neighborhood band together to fight children from other
neighborhoods to assert their power. People take other people to
court over petty differences to satisfy their greed and spite. Divorce is
on the increase, and assaults against young girls are rampant. There
are some who recognize the spiritual void, but instead of turning to
the King, they look to man–made idols, divination, and witchcraft.”

“What about inside Zaben’s stronghold?”
“The situation inside the palace grounds is better. The presence
of the host provides a buffer; however, there is still unrest and a sense
of dread. Those who live within the complex aren’t experiencing the
misfortunes of those in the surrounding areas, but everybody is always
on edge and suffers from restless sleep.”
“Benjamin and Rachael?”
“Our chief treasurer is having some difficulty meeting budgets
due to falling revenues. His faith remains strong, though. Their ten–
month–old boy, James, is generally healthy, although he fights colic.
Benjamin rarely ventures outside the palace grounds because he can
sense the darkness around them. And with all the stories of wild
animal attacks and roadside robbers, Rachael prefers to keep herself
and James within the safety of the palace walls.”
Timrok and his team approached the command center at the
outer rim of all the devastation. The battle itself swirled high into
the sky a short distance away, but everywhere he looked, he saw the
far–reaching effects of evil on every living thing.
“This is why I fight,” Timrok said. “To destroy the works of the
enemy, and to defend the honor of the King.”
“You will get that chance today,” Kai said.
Timrok felt like they were a flock of tiny hawks dispatched to
stop the raging winds of a hurricane. He picked up his pace, gritted
his teeth, pulled out his two swords, and began their final dive onto
the command center.
***

INTO THE SEAT OF DARKNESS

93

Timrok’s team of commandos pounced on the seat of darkness
from behind, and the audacious appearance of the dazzling elzurim
sent the dozen demons in the makeshift throne room jumping
like startled cats. Mostly lesser spirits filled the command center,
messengers for the higher–ranking ones on the front line, and
Timrok’s team bound half of them before they knew what hit them.
The other half met the brawl with bared fangs and swinging swords.
At the same time, Kai breached the room feet first through the
roof and landed a massive blow on Marr’s chest before the evil prince
could draw his sword. The two tumbled to the floor, and both of their
swords clanged to the ground, landing together in the corner out of
reach. The two giant spirits locked arms and tried to overpower each
other as they struggled back to their feet. The touch of one immovable
power on the other caused a spontaneous release of energy, and the
places where their hands, arms, and thrashing torsos made contact
sizzled with searing flames and blinding sparks. The two brawns
grappled, and a surging cloud of energy and smoke enveloped them.
None of the other spirits dared to even approach their dangerous
sphere of conflict.
Timrok pulled his sword out of the chest of a stunned demon,
bound him in a cord of light, and dropped him to the ground.
Timrok leapt back behind the throne out of the fray to take stock
of their situation. His eyes went first to the throne itself. Satan had
disappeared. Timrok scanned the entire command center. No sign of
the mighty cherub. Timrok grimaced and nodded. It’s just as well. We
would not have stood if he had stayed for the fight.
He turned his attention to Marr and Kai. They stayed locked in
an arm hold, well matched, with sparks and fire and smoke shooting

94

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

from their embrace. The whole room filled with smoke, the smell of
burning sulfur, and the sounds of war cries and shrieking demons.
Timrok surveyed the rest of the battle. His team fought with their
usual prowess—wrangling multiple demons at once, flipping,
spinning, bounding downward from the ceiling—every movement
fluid, purposeful, and lightning fast. The beaelzurim pinged and
darted in a frenzy. Some purposed to drive the elzurim out, fighting
and thrusting and releasing bound comrades. Some demons tried
to disentangle themselves from the skirmish and escape the control
room, but they could not escape the speed of Timrok’s team.
Timrok jumped up and stood on the armrests of the throne to
oversee the fight. The battle settled into a rhythm. With the large
number of demons in the room, his team couldn’t bind them all. As
soon as they could bind one, another would be released by a comrade.
His team had sufficient numbers, however, to keep the command
center contained. And from his position Timrok could see if any
enemy might break away. He watched and waited.
A new demon messenger appeared from outside. He stepped in
through the front wall, saw the battle, and bounded upward toward
the ceiling. Timrok shot from his position and caught the demon
by the ankle before he escaped. With one hand he slung the demon
downward and with the other he sliced the demon in half with his
sword. He whipped bindings around the surprised spirit before he hit
the ground.
Timrok returned to his position on top of the throne and stood
with his blades ready.

he mysterious child King of Israel was now 375 days old by the
calculation of the Persian magi, and with great anticipation the
three gray-beards gathered outside their Zoroastrian temple for

some great revelation from the heavens about the location of the King.
Astronomy instruments and charts littered their table, along with a
modest clay bowl filled with figs and a carafe of lukewarm water.

“Tonight could be the night,” Melchior said.
Caspar and Balthazar nodded.
Caspar rehearsed the prophecy from the scroll. “‘At journey’s
end, the star alights above the head of the King of stars . . . ’”
95

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Melchior answered, “‘Wise is he who seeks it.’”
“Keyvân completes its journey to opposition tonight,” Balthazar
said. “So, hopefully we will see some celestial body stay in a fixed
position over the place where the Child is to be found.”
“I expect it to be bright and obvious,” Melchior said.
Caspar stroked his long beard. “It would not surprise me if we
see a sky full of celestial beings singing a song.”
“That would be most enlightening,” Melchior said.
A year of anticipation had brought them to the very edge of their
perseverance, and they met this night with high hopes.
Until the clouds rolled in.
Before any of the heavenly lights could become visible, a thick
layer of clouds piled in. The starry panorama became obscured by
an impenetrable wall of darkness. The three men slumped into
their chairs and stared into the black sky. All the excitement and
expectation fell from their faces, dripped off their sagging shoulders,
and evaporated into the starless night as it became obvious that the
clouds were going to stay.
After several hours of sitting in speechless darkness, Melchior
stood up, pulled a fig from the bowl, threw it toward the chirping
crickets, and announced, “I am going to bed.”
Caspar replied with a defeated voice, “I shall stay here and
continue watching, just in case.”
“As shall I,” said Balthazar.
“As you wish. These clouds are not going to clear tonight.”
Melchior stopped and turned back toward the table, “But if they do,
be sure to wake me.”
“Of course,” replied Caspar.

Caspar and Balthazar tried to maintain their vigil, but after
another hour of dark inactivity, Balthazar fell asleep where he sat.
Caspar lasted a little longer, but eventually sleep overtook him, too.
Melchior woke the two the next morning. “Did anything happen
after I went to bed?” he asked.
Thick clouds still covered the sky. Caspar and Balthazar rubbed
the sleep out of their eyes, looked up at the gray clouds, and kneaded
their stiff necks.
“Not a thing,” answered Caspar. “I can’t believe we waited a year
for that.”
“Now what?” Balthazar asked.
“Perhaps it doesn’t matter,” said Melchior. “I think Hormoz is
the one we need to be watching anyway, and it does not complete
its journey for another 24 days. I say we wait and see what happens
then.”
“We have no other choice,” Caspar said. “We know nothing
more now than we did a year ago.”
Balthazar stood. “I’m hungry. I’m getting something to eat.”
***
Nangar sat atop the astrological charts of the magi and watched
them trudge back into the temple. He rubbed his forehead and
brooded.
How do I get them to step out? They have contemplated searching
for the newborn King of Israel for a year now. I prod them and prod
them, and still they delay. Intellectual interest and mystic curiosity aren’t
enough. They feel too safe and familiar with their temple, their ancient

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

98

scrolls, and their research. The trip to a foreign country is too far and
too hard, especially with little hope of actually finding something o nly
intellectually interesting.
But I can’t turn this into a spiritual quest. For years I have blinded
them to the one true King. The last thing I want is for them turn to
Him now. It was a close call last year when the heralding angelic host
announced His birth. They planted a seed that almost took root. H e
chuckled. But I stole the seed. I replaced it with intellect and reasoning.
But that doesn’t help me get them moving.
He hopped down from the table and ambled inside. The three
magi sat in sullen silence around a table, eating a barley loaf and
a bowl of grapes. Nangar slinked back into the corner shadows.
“You don’t need another sign,” he cooed. “Go. Strike out for
Israel now. Twenty-four more days is too long to wait.” His words
floated through the spiritual air and blanketed the three men. “Think
of the knowledge you will gain by seeing the Child,” he continued.
“Seek Him now. No more delays. Go to Jerusalem and start your
search. You are clever—and very wise. Surely you have the ability
to . . . ”
Balthazar stood up. “I’m going to the library to search through
more scrolls.”
“No!” Nangar said. “No more delays.”
Caspar dropped his piece of bread onto the table. “I’ll go with
you.”
In the library, the three magi rummaged through piles of scrolls.
Nangar wrung his hands and muttered, “There’s nothing more here.
It’s no use. Get out there and search for the Child.”

STEP OF FAITH

99

Melchior rolled up a scroll and placed it back on a pile of scrolls
on an inset shelf in the wall. “Sometimes I think we search in vain.”
“Keep looking,” Balthazar said.
“Here,” Caspar said. “This might be something.”
“What is it?” Balthazar asked without looking up from his own
scroll.
“Ancient Jewish manuscripts, left by exiles. They appear to be
sacred writings. There are probably a dozen books here.”
“No!” shouted Nangar. “Do not read those! There is nothing of
value there.” He wrung his hands faster. Aarrg. I kept those hidden all
this time. How did he find them?
Melchior slid another scroll from the shelf across the room and
spread it out on a table. “I have read portions of those before. There
is nothing of value there, only religious rituals and strict moral code.”
“Still,” Caspar said, “we seek a Jewish king. It is logical to
investigate Jewish writings. Since we are looking for specific clues,
perhaps something new will present itself.” He sifted through the
stack of parchments and laid one on top. He whispered aloud, “‘In
the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth . . . ’”
Beams of light shone down through the Middle Realm onto
Caspar. Most reflected off his helmet of darkness and floated away into
nothing. Some beams hit the parchment, and the parchment gave off
a warm glow. Tiny waves of light reverberated from the glowing page
and pulsed against Caspar’s spirit. Light completely surrounded him.
“No, no, no,” mumbled Nangar.
Caspar kept reading—all afternoon and late into the evening.
The next morning, Caspar handed Balthazar a pile of manuscripts.
“You should read these Jewish writings.”

100

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Why? Have you found an instructive prophecy?”
“No, but I’m beginning to think that . . . I wonder if . . . well,
read these and we’ll talk.”
“No, no, no,” droned Nangar.
Balthazar read. Caspar read other Jewish scripts. Beams of light
gleamed down.
At midday, Melchior rolled up another fruitless scroll and placed
it back on its shelf. He shuffled over to the table where Balthazar and
Caspar sat, engrossed in their reading. “You two have not said a word
all morning. Are these writings providing direction? What have you
discovered?”
“Caspar is right,” Balthazar said. “These books require more
study. I also have read portions of these manuscripts over the years,
but presently, I am seeing more here than I ever had.”
“More? More what?”
Balthazar shook his head. “It is hard to explain. But these writings
are more than moral code. More than religious ritual. Behind it all
is—”
“One true God,” Caspar said, just above a whisper. “The true
creator of the universe, the giver of life.”
“And,” Balthazar said, “He is not a mystic, unknowable
power—but a personal entity, with intellect, character, and desire for
fellowship.”
Beams of light radiated down on all three magi. Caspar and
Balthazar’s words entered the Middle Realm and spiraled like sparks
through the air. Their helmets of darkness eroded with each strike
of a spark, and their dark breastplates became thinner and thinner.
Nangar huddled in the corner.

STEP OF FAITH

101

Caspar added, “Enough of a desire for fellowship to come to
earth and live amongst men.”
Melchior sat with eyes wide and took a long, deep breath. “Like
we heard in the vision last year.”
“I believe they were angels,” Caspar said.
“No!” Nangar shouted. “There are no angels! Enough of this.
That vision wasn’t even real. We should leave now. Let us find this
child King—the King foretold in the stars. You will see that He is
nothing more than a normal baby. He is surely not God.” His words
shot from the shadows, passed into the rays of light, and dissolved
before they could reach the men.
“Here,” Balthazar said. He dropped a stack of parchments in
front of Melchior. “Read for yourself.”
All three read for the remainder of the day amid a shower of light
from the Throne.
The next morning, the magi rose and returned to the Jewish
manuscripts. Nangar paced. I must stop this. The King is drawing
them away. These men are mine. He stopped and smiled. I know—this
will slow them down. He opened the palm of his hand and spoke,
“Sickness. Influenza.” A ball of flaming plasma formed in his hand.
He spun it with his fingertips, and it swirled and divided into three
balls. With a sneer on his lips, he flung the fireballs at the magi. The
flaming darts sank deep into their spirits. Nangar chuckled.
Midmorning, Caspar said, “I have developed a headache. Perhaps
I have been studying too hard.” He rubbed his throat and sniffled.
“Perhaps I should rest for a while.” He rose and left the library.
Not long after, Melchior said, “Actually, I’m not feeling well
myself.” He stepped out.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

102

Only minutes later, Balthazar coughed, rubbed his throat, and
left.
Nangar sat on the table and let out a long sigh. “That’s better.”
The next morning, Nangar sat alone in the library. The following
morning, Nangar remained alone. The third morning, each of the
men came and read for a few hours. The light from the King beamed
strong, but the weakened flesh of the men filtered most of it out.
“This is what becomes of those who seek God,” Nangar jeered.
“He is punishing you for your unworthiness. He strikes you down
with sickness.”
They returned to bed.
The next morning, all three returned to the library, looking
stronger. They went straight to reading. Through sniffling noses and
raspy coughs, they studied all day. The intensity of the light from the
Throne drove Nangar to the farthest side of the room.
They studied again the next day. Nangar crouched in the corner.
I’m losing them . . . I’m losing them. I only hope that eventually they will
search for the Child and lead me to Him.
Two more weeks passed.
“We approach day number 399,” Balthazar said.
“I can’t wait to see the message the God of Heaven has prepared
for us,” Caspar said.
“Answers,” said Melchior. “Soon we will have answers.”
The day finally arrived. Once again, the magi had their table set
out with all the requisite instruments and scrolls. Once again, they
fidgeted and looked to the skies.
Once again, the clouds rolled in.

“This is unbelievable,” Balthazar said. The three magi collected
their equipment from the table. “How can it be that there is a cloudy
night on two of the most important nights in history? Every day for
the last two weeks has been perfectly clear!”
Melchior, with hands full of instruments and parchments,
wrestled the door with his elbows. “Personally, I don’t think it is a
coincidence.”
The three stepped inside and walked toward the library.
“Probably not,” said Balthazar, “but we did not foresee anything
like this in our horoscopes. In fact, all the signs seemed to indicate the
opposite. We should have seen something remarkable on one of these
two nights. Something tangible with which we could work.”
Melchior dropped his instruments on the library table. “I think
this is something bigger than the stars. I think the God of the Hebrews
is trying to tell us something. What if these clouds are meant as a sign
to us?”
“But I thought a star was supposed to be the sign,” said Balthazar.
“We have been working under the premise that a guiding star
would appear at the end of the journey of either Keyvân or Hormoz.
But the prophecy does not specify whose journey is made. What if
the ‘journey’ refers to our journey? What if we are supposed to begin
our search without full knowledge of his location, and at the end of
our journey, He will guide us with a star?”
“It makes sense,” Caspar said. “From all we have been reading
in the Hebrew Scriptures, this God of Abraham rewards those who
move forward in faith.”

104

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Melchior rubbed the back of his neck. “I can’t explain it, but I
have a sense deep within me that this God wants to be found by us.
And I want to find Him. And not because I think it is an interesting
thing to study, but because I am beginning to believe that He is—”
“Truly God,” Balthazar finished.
“Exactly. And I want to see Him and offer Him my worship.”
All three men’s eyes shined with wild excitement.
Nangar crouched in the corner. The presence and work of the Holy
Spirit is too strong in the room. I am powerless to speak. He snorted a
puff of yellow smoke. It is no matter, though. I have already lost these
men. And I concede these three insignificant men for the chance to find
the Child. Perhaps they might actually, finally, begin their search.
“I say we leave as soon as we can put together provisions for the
trip,” announced Caspar.
“I agree,” said Melchior.
Balthazar nodded. “We still don’t know where to even begin the
search,” he said.
“We should head toward Jerusalem,” said Melchior. “Surely the
Israelites will know where He is. After all, He is their king. We will
go directly to the capital and make inquiry there. Who knows, maybe
He will already be in the palace. Or in their temple.”
The trek from the magi’s far eastern home to Jerusalem would
take at least two months, and the three magi made lengthy and
involved preparations for the extended desert passage. Part of the
preparations included a gift for the King of Heaven.
“We clearly should present Him with gold, and I have set aside a
good part of my treasury to dedicate to Him,” Balthazar announced.
“I have also,” said Caspar. “How about silver?”

STEP OF FAITH

105

Melchior shook his head. “Definitely not. Silver may be a
sufficient gift for an earthly king, but this King is worthy of only the
finest. Nothing less than gold.”
“Spices and incense?” Caspar said.
Balthazar nodded. “It is a customary gift. I believe it would be
expected. But which ones are precious enough?”
Caspar said, “Cinnamon? Cassia? Pepper? Cardamom? Ginger?
Cloves?” Each spice earned a wrinkled nose and apathetic shrugs
from Melchior and Balthazar.
Nangar sat in the shadows shaking his head. I grow weary of
this banter over the King. “How about frankincense and myrrh?” His
words floated through the Middle Realm and rested on the magi. He
laughed to himself at the rich irony of the suggestion. He is going to
need them when I get finished with Him.
Caspar paused. “Frankincense? Myrrh?”
“Burial spices?” Balthazar shot a surprised glance with raised
eyebrows. “Does that not seem a strange gift for a baby?”
Melchior stroked his beard. “Why not? They are the most
expensive of the incenses and spices we could offer. He would
certainly have no immediate use for them; however, they are highly
valuable—gifts worthy of a king.”
Caspar nodded. “None of the other spices are right. They are
simply too common.”
“Very well, frankincense and myrrh will be part of our gift.”
After three days of preparation, they loaded several months’
worth of packs stuffed with tents, food, water, and necessities onto
a good–sized caravan of camels. Wooden chests carried gold, silver,
and precious spices—some for restocking their supplies for the return

106

trip, and some to present to King Herod as the customary gift when
seeking an audience with a foreign dignitary. And they carried the gift
specially prepared for the King of Kings.

With every plodding step of the camels along the dry, dusty trail
to Jerusalem, steady streams of light rained down on the magi in the
Middle Realm. Nangar followed but kept his distance. He reached a
hiding spot and waited for the caravan to cross the next valley.
I’m beginning to think this might actually work. Look at that. The
King is constantly speaking to them. They have torn down most of the
strongholds I have built up all these years, and the words of the King are
penetrating. Actually, this is better than I had planned. If they can hear
Him, He will lead them. I don’t care that I’ve lost them. I would gladly
trade the souls of these three men for glory that awaits me for delivering
the Son of Man to destruction. Keep speaking. Keep leading.
Two months of gritty travel passed—six camels, three men,
and a skulking spirit. Finally, in mid-evening, the city of Jerusalem
appeared in the distance. The shining gold dome of the temple glowed
like a beacon in the setting sun. The magi decided to set up camp for
the night, being too late to cover the remaining distance and still
obtain an audience with Herod. They would start out at first light
with fresh, brightly colored garb to honor the royal court. Tonight,
they would spend under the stars again, still anticipating some kind
of star to guide them the rest of the way. Tomorrow they would stand
before Herod.

imrok stood on the armrests of the dark throne and tracked every
movement of the battle inside Marr’s command center. For three
months, not one of Marr’s minions had escaped Timrok’s grasp,

and no messages from the outside had penetrated with news from the
main battle. Above him hung a thick cloud of smoke. Below him, strewn
across the weathered stone floor, lay over a dozen bound beaelzurim,
writhing and shouting curses at his team. To his left, his team of five
warriors had their hands full.

Prestus, one of his warriors, blocked a blow from one demon
with his shield while thrusting his own blade toward another. His
107

108

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

thrust missed its mark, and he sprang upward and somersaulted over
a swinging blade, landing behind his first attacker and clipping the
demon’s leg with his sword. The demon squealed.
Chase, another one of Timrok’s warriors, had one demon beaten
and flat on his back, but before Chase could bind him, the demon
rolled to his right and sliced through the bindings of light of a captive.
Chase now battled two.
Another demon cut another captive loose. Kylek shot up toward
the open ceiling and caught the escaping demon by the waist. The two
spiraled downward. They crashed on the ground, and Kylek blocked
the sword of another attacker while on his back. Sparks flashed from
the colliding steel. He bounded to his feet and met the attack, but
lost track of the escaping demon. That demon lunged toward Kylek’s
unsuspecting back.
Micah disengaged from the two demons he fought and leapt
toward Kylek. He hacked through the arm of the attacker just before
his blade reached Kylek’s back. The demon’s sword clanged to the
floor, and sulfurous smoke belched from his severed arm. Micah
bound that demon in a blink and re-engaged the other two.
Nalyd locked in a grappling match with a demon larger than
himself. They rolled and tumbled as all the other fighters jumped over
and around them.
Timrok turned his attention to his right.
Marr and Kai fought a fierce sword battle. The crashing swords
of these two giants made the others look like child’s play. Their
swords hummed with energy. The blades roared as they severed
the air. They exploded with power on impact—rending the air like
thunder. Both combatants stood solid as stone at the collision of

DARKNESS UNLEASHED

109

their blades, but the shockwave of their contact sent nearby warriors
reeling.
Marr made a spinning lunge toward Kai. Kai deflected the blade
downward and somersaulted over Marr’s head. He landed and made
a power swing toward Marr’s turned back. Marr spun with a roar,
and their blades met with a crash. They locked in place. The energy
from their touching blades crackled and created a fireball with searing
sparks flying everywhere. Marr jabbed his other hand toward Kai’s
face. Kai caught Marr’s hand in mid-thrust and locked arms. Using
the momentum of Marr’s fist, Kai pulled Marr forward and flipped
him over backward.
The two giant spirits flipped across the room, and Timrok
jumped straight up to avoid getting plowed over. The fighters on the
left side of the room didn’t see them coming, and half of them were
trampled like unsuspecting insects. The two brawns’ swords collided
again and sent the other half flailing from the shock. The battle of the
lesser spirits shifted to the right side of the room. One demon made
a break toward the front wall.
“No, you don’t!” Timrok shouted. He shot from his position
and caught the demon outside the stone ruins. Timrok seized his
ankle with one hand and flung him downward. With his other
hand, Timrok drove his sword through the demon’s chest. The two
spiraled downward through a cloud of yellow smoke. The demon hit
the ground with Timrok’s blade still protruding through his chest
and out this back, the tip of the blade pinning him to the ground.
Timrok bound him and pulled his blade back. He hoisted the captive
by the back of the bindings and tossed him back into the command
center.

Timrok paused and looked across the plain toward Zaben’s
stronghold. The battle still raged. Why has there been so little traffic
from the main battle to the control center over the last three months? He
imagined the generals on the front line commanding their hordes
and exercising their control. He shook his head. The generals are too
arrogant to seek direction from the control room. And they’re reluctant to
send a messenger with news for fear that the messenger would return with
directives. He shook his head again and returned to his position back
on top of the throne.
Marr and Kai battled on the left again, and Timrok’s team
fought on the right. Three frenzied demons attacked one of Timrok’s
warriors with their backs to the battling giants. In a defensive move,
Kai leapt backward in a tight back flip. He landed near the sparring
warriors and swung his blade in an upward full–circle motion toward
the pouncing Marr. Kai’s blade smashed into the three demons on the
backswing and catapulted them out of the building. Marr brought a
crushing blow down on Kai’s ready blade and thundered orders to
the three.
“Escape, you fools! Take word to the front,” he roared. “Release
the generals! Tell them all to attack. Hold nothing back!”
The three messengers bolted toward the main battlefront, and
Marr pressed his blade toward Kai with a low, guttural growl. “I am
tired of waiting for my master to authorize the use of my strongest
forces. Today your puny stronghold will be crushed by my word.”
Timrok shot out of the command center. The messengers were
already halfway to the battlefront. Timrok blazed forward. Faster!
Faster! Aha! He snagged two of them by their heels and dragged them
to the ground. In two quick strokes he subdued and bound them, but

the third streaked onward with an evil, high–pitched shriek. Timrok
launched forward and flew with furious speed, gaining on him with
every stroke. His focus zeroed in. This one cannot deliver his message.
Almost there . . . almost there . . . now I have you . . .
Zzzz-whump! A force hammered his back from above. He gasped
for air and spun around, face up. Oh, no! I’ve gone too far into their . . .
Twenty enemy warriors pounced on him. Two grabbed one
wing. Three seized the other. Timrok thrashed—both blades
whizzing and carving clouds of yellow smoke. There are too many!
The writhing mass plummeted downward. An enemy sword slashed
through his left arm. “Aughhh!” His sword tumbled away. “Arrghh!”
Light burst forth from a wound on his leg. He gritted his teeth and
swung the sword in his right hand with all his waning strength. His
blade crashed against an attacker’s blade, shooting sparks through the
sulfur cloud. At the same instant, an attacker from behind clipped his
right arm, and his sword flew off into the air. Dazed and disoriented,
Timrok clenched his teeth. An attacker landed his feet on Timrok’s
chest. Timrok blinked. The jagged demon sword drove straight into
his chest. Everything went black.
Timrok opened his eyes. From the flat of his back, he watched
a rabid pack of beaelzurim swarm around him on the ground. He
jerked upward but couldn’t move. Bindings constricted him from his
neck to his feet, and an enemy warrior’s foot held him to the ground.
He looked back toward the headquarters where his team was
fighting. None emerged to help him. They are too disciplined to deviate
from their orders and too outnumbered to rally a rescue.
He looked into the seething darkness. Yes, the escaped messenger
completed his task. Besides the thousands of attackers already

swarming the fortress, lines of massive beaelzurim now pressed in
around Zaben’s stronghold from all directions, their red glowing eyes
burning holes through the thick darkness. The largest of the enemy,
the generals who had been held in reserve, hurled flaming balls of
energy into the lines of angelic defenses.
To Timrok’s right, a nearby general formed a pulsing sphere of
energy in his palm until it became a huge, blazing red and orange ball
of flame. The general released it, and the energy ball cracked through
the air at the speed of light and blasted through the first two layers of
fortification. The inner layer of defenses deflected the bombardment,
but it tore open dangerous holes in the outer layers. The swirling
hordes of attackers pressed their advantage through the openings, and
the defenders barely kept them from penetrating into the center of

Timrok let his head drop to the ground. He took as deep a breath

arly the next morning, Molech, the demon commander who
ruled from the human palace in Jerusalem, manipulated his
puppet, Herod the Great, with his usual words. The court was

quiet and idle for that time of day, but Herod’s mind was active with the
dark torments that filled his troubled days and fitful nights.

And what about the Primus pilus? the familiar voice in Herod’s
head jabbed. How do we truly know where his loyalties lie? Maybe Caesar
hand-picked him to overthrow my rule to bring in a Roman governor.
Maybe he intends to lead a coup and take the throne himself.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

A demon captain entered the court. “Master, a visitor from the
eastern region.”
Molech’s eyes tightened, and he nodded once. He would have to
let Herod’s mind meander off unguided into the irrational dark alleys
of suspicion and treachery. But he had been down that path so many
times, he knew the way all too well.
Nangar stepped forward and bowed. “Master Molech,” he said,
“I bring to you a gift from the east that I think you will find most
interesting.”
Molech stepped out of Herod’s body and stood on the elevated
platform above Nangar. With a sneer he answered, “What is it?”
“I have three men who are seeking the Christ child.”
Molech laughed a loud, mocking laugh and sat down on his
spiritual throne. “Then your men have come to the wrong place.
Marr has the Child surrounded in a stronghold in Egypt. While I
am left here in this miserable place with only a handful of worthless
malcontents, Marr’s special forces are poised for a glorious victory in
which I will have no part.”
Molech blew a snort of sulfurous smoke through his nostrils
and opened his right palm where a fiery red ball of energy formed.
He crushed it within his closing fist and swatted the residual smoke
toward Nangar. “Take your men to Egypt.”
“I have reason to believe the Child may be here in your region,”
Nangar pressed.
“You are a pitiful fool. Marr’s armies scoured this entire region
for months. There is nothing here. What makes you think you know
more than everyone else?”

KING’S QUEST

115

Nangar scowled and took a step toward the door. He stopped
and looked around at all the spiritual power standing in the court.
He paused and returned to the throne. “Because I am convinced they
are being directly led by the Spirit of the King. His presence is
strong in them—I cannot even speak to them anymore. I assure you
he wants these men to find Him.”
“But why would He lead them here? I have already told you the
Child is in Egypt.”
From behind the shadows came a small spirit in the form of a
snake. His deep red eyes glowed with wisdom, and his voice echoed
with smooth intrigue as he slithered toward the throne.
“What if Marr is wrong?” the snake said. His black forked tongue
shot in and out. “What if the Child is actually hidden somewhere
here in your jurisdiction? Think of the glory that could be yours if
you—”
“Perhaps you may be right,” Molech said to Nangar, “this is a
most interesting gift you bring. Have these men appear before Herod.”
“They are already on their way. They should be here any moment.”
“Good. And if the Spirit of the King is with them as strongly as
you say, it would be best if we clear the court of all the beaelzurim
but me, lest the King suspect our intentions and lead the men away.”
All the demons stood still and silent, looking toward the throne
with questioning eyes.
“You heard me,” Molech blasted, “clear the court! All of you.”
The attending spirits filed out, but Nangar lingered. “Surely you
do not also mean me? After all, it was I who brought them—”
“I alone will stay with Herod. I will call when I am ready for
you.”

The snake glided across the marble floor in a southward direction
without another word.

Minutes later one of Herod’s attendants approached the king
with a message. “Your highness, three magi from the far east seek an
audience with you. They have brought these gifts to honor you and
your kingdom.”
Four other attendants entered. They carried boxes and set them
before the throne. They raised the lids and revealed gold, silver, and
many precious spices. The gold and silver glistened in the morning
sun beaming through the arched windows, and the rich smell of the
exotic spices filled the room with captivating warmth.
“What is their business in Israel?” Herod asked.
“They seek . . . ” The attendant paused a moment, looked around
at the guards, swallowed hard, and said, “To see the newborn king of
Israel.”
“The newborn king of . . . ” Herod’s fists clenched. He sat upright
to the edge of his throne.
Herod relaxed and sat back in his chair and replied, “How
interesting. These must be men of surpassing wisdom if they have
knowledge of a new king that I have not heard of. Please show our
guests in.”
The magi appeared regal in their brightly colored robes and
turbans. They carried themselves with great dignity and took their
place in front of the throne.

KING’S QUEST

117

With his head bowed, one announced, “Mighty Herod, King of
the Jews, your fame and greatness is known throughout the world,
even in Persia, our country from which we have traveled these two
months. Thank you for granting an audience with your humble
servants. We are indeed honored to stand in your presence. I am
Balthazar.”
“Thank you for your kind gifts. I do love receiving spices from
the east. Please, step forward and tell me what brings you on your
long journey to Jerusalem.”
Another said, “I am Caspar. Where is He who has been born
King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east, and have come to
worship Him.”
The third added, “I am Melchior. We mean no disrespect to your
highness, but we believe this Child to be the King of all kings, the
very Son of God. We honor you and your nation for being the one to
whom this great gift has been given.”
Herod stroked his beard, “Very interesting. Word of this child
had not reached my ears until now. How did you come upon this
great revelation?”
They explained their journey had started with the appearance of
the king’s star and the triple conjunction, and they gave a brief lesson
on astrology and the significance of the event. They told about the
amazing display of the angelic host and the message they brought.
“The problem that remains for us,” Caspar continued, “is that we
do not know His location—only that He is here in Israel somewhere.”
Balthazar said, “Naturally, we assumed that you would have
already known about this and would probably have Him here in your
great palace.”

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

118

Herod shook his head, “Unfortunately for all of us, that is not
the case. Not only is he not here, this is the first news of a new king
that I have received. You were wise to come to me first, though, for
even though I know not the location of this new king, I will not send
you away empty-handed. I shall call for all my wisest counselors and
priests to see where the king was to be born. It will take several hours
before I can gather everyone. Until then, please enjoy the hospitality
of the palace.”
Herod called to one of his attendants, “Show my honored guests
to our finest quarters. See to all their needs and the needs of their
beasts.”
Then turning again to the magi, he said, “I will call for you after
my council has convened.”
The magi bowed and left the court followed by several attendants.
***
The summons for all the chief priests and scribes went out, and
word about the magi’s quest filtered throughout Jerusalem. Troubled
questions filled the streets.
“Could it truly be that the Messiah has been born?”
“What will Herod’s reaction be?”
“Are we to have more war and oppression before the Messiah is
old enough to deliver us?”
The word also reached the ears of the beaelzurim in the city, and
they had questions of their own.
“What if Marr is wrong and that the Child is right here?
“What will Satan’s reaction be?”

KING’S QUEST

119

“Who will be the fortunate one to find the Child and strike
the fatal blow—thus earning the most honored position in the new
kingdom?”
The buzz within the spiritual world reached such a level that
Molech called all the captains of the city and issued an edict.
“No actions shall be taken to either find the Child or to attack
Him until I give the word. If He is indeed here, the elzurim have been
able to keep Him hidden from us until now, so there is no reason to
believe that we will be able to find Him on our own. Instead, we are
going to use these men. For whatever reason the King is guiding them
to Himself, so we must not disrupt their quest. If they do find Him,
we will know it. And then we will mount our attack. Send the orders.
Go now.”
The demon captains flew from the palace court.
A large group of chief priests and scribes filed in. They milled
about for an hour, talking, sharing ideas, waxing philosophical, and
trying to impress each other with their extensive knowledge of the
Scriptures. They discussed the messianic references about Egypt and
Nazareth, but after only a small debate, they reached consensus that
Bethlehem was most likely the birthplace of the promised messiah.
They reported to the king.
“The Christ is to be born in Bethlehem of Judea, for so it has
been written by the prophet, ‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are
by no means least among the leaders of Judah; for out of you shall
come forth a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’”
With the magi absent, Molech allowed the regular contingent of
demons to stay for the council. The demons responded to the chief
priests’ report with incredulous looks and remarks.

120

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Bethlehem? These men are mistaken.”
“Of course, we know of those prophecies, but there is no palace
in Bethlehem worthy of the King’s Son.”
“We scoured all of Bethlehem for months and found nothing.”
“This prophecy could mean that the Son will live in Bethlehem
when He is older.”
Molech silenced the court with an upraised hand and spoke
through Herod to the men. “Bethlehem, you say? This is very good
information. Thank you all for your excellent wisdom. Tell me, do the
Scriptures indicate exactly where in Bethlehem He might be found?”
The council muddled around with this more difficult question
for several minutes and reported they knew of no clear references to
an exact location.
Herod followed up, “What about the time of His birth? Do the
Scriptures indicate when He is to be born?”
This sparked considerable debate. Some believed they could
pinpoint the time; some opposed such presumptuousness; and others
weren’t sure. In the end, they reported they could not specify a date
with any confidence.
“Is it possible the time is now? Is there anything that precludes
His birth from taking place during our time?”
On this point the council had nearly unanimous consensus. It
was possible that the Christ could be born during their time.
Herod thanked them all again and sent them on their way. With
the court empty again except for Herod’s attendants, Herod’s dark
thoughts took over.
This newborn king will mark the end of my kingdom if I do not do
something immediately, the voice inside his head prodded. I must find

the child and kill him before he becomes known and powerful. But I must
not allow the people to know. If they find out that I have killed the one
whom they believe could have been their messiah, they will surely revolt.
This will be a most delicate matter; the whole city is already talking about
him. I must accomplish this quickly, and I must accomplish it secretly.
His identity must never be known to the people. I cannot send troops
out to find him because the people will know the order came from me. I
know—I will use the magi. They are already on a quest to find him. I
shall tell them to return here and report his location once they have found
him.
Molech dismissed his attendants. Herod dismissed all his
attendants but one.
Herod called the remaining attendant forward. “I will see the
magi in private now. Fetch them discreetly.”
Within minutes the magi stood before the king again.
Herod greeted them. “Thank you for waiting. I trust your stay
has been pleasant?”
The three nodded and bowed before the king.
“I sought the counsel of my most learned priests, and I am happy
to report they all agree the king you seek is to be born in Bethlehem
of Judah. They could not give an exact location, but I am confident
men of your great wisdom will be able to find him, if he is indeed
there. How long ago did you see the star?”
“It has been nearly a year and a half,” Caspar said.
“This is a long time,” Herod said. “We can only hope the child
is still there.”
“We believe in our hearts he is,” Melchior answered.

122

“Go then to Bethlehem in peace with my blessing,” Herod said.
“Go and search carefully for the Child, and when you have found
Him, report to me, so that I too may come and worship Him.”
“You are a wise and gracious ruler.” Balthazar bowed. “Thank
you for your hospitality and kind help. We will certainly find the
Child and return here as you request. Now, if it pleases the king, we
will take our leave.”
The magi left the court, and Molech called for Nangar and a
beaelzur captain.
“The men are headed to Bethlehem,” Molech said. “My hope is
they truly are being led by the King and that they will find the Son of
Man.” To Nangar he said, “You may continue following your charges,
but see to it you do not give the enemy reason to change course.”
To the captain he said, “Form a detail and follow behind at a safe
distance. If you make contact, report back to me immediately so we
can prepare an offensive.”

n Bethlehem, a stealthy snake weaved its way through every
dark shadow in the city. He crossed an unmarked territorial
line, and Luchek’s blade smashed down onto the ground in

front of his nose.

“What are you doing here?” demanded Luchek.
“I am merely passing through,” replied the snake. His forked
black tongue shot in and out.
“Are you on some particular mission? For whom do you work?”
“I work for no one. I merely wander the world seeking
opportunities.”
123

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“There are no opportunities for you here. This area is under my
control. Turn around and continue your work elsewhere.”
“Well, well,” said the snake in a smooth, low voice, “a warrior
of position and influence. You must be very powerful to control an
entire area of the city.”
“Not only is this district mine, but I command an entire team.”
“A team? It requires great power and wisdom to hold a team
together. A team, you say? Then are you on some special mission
yourself?”
“It is a secret mission, and you are asking too many questions,
little one. Be gone now before I have you forcibly removed.”
“A secret mission? A dark and treacherous one, I presume? I live
for missions like that. Do you have room on your team for one more?”
Luchek eyed him with suspicion. “You don’t even know who our
target is, and yet you wish to join my team?”
“Hmm, so there is a specific target?” the snake cooed. “This must
be a very important target to warrant an entire team, led by a great
warrior like you. Now I am even more intrigued.”
“Why should I let you in? What could you possibly offer that
would strengthen my position?”
The snake glowered and answered, “I am quite effective in a
fight, and I know many things from my travels.”
“Then,” Luchek shot back, “tell me something useful that I do
not know . . . something ‘from all your travels.’”
The snake became very quiet. “There is word that Marr has
made a fatal mistake—that the Christ child may actually be hidden
somewhere here in Judea. And . . . ” he paused.
“And what?”

125

“It would not concern you. You have your mission here. As a
matter of fact, I think I shall move along. I would rather find a more
significant operation than . . . this.”
“Wait! You must tell me more of what you know.”
“No, it is not relevant to you. I will be going now.”
“Wait, wait. You can join my team. Tell me what you know.”
“You first. What is your mission here?”
Luchek said, “It’s true.” He looked all around and whispered.
“The King’s Son is here. I have Him surrounded.”
“How remarkable. How do you know it is Him?”
“It’s a long story, but trust me, I know with no doubt that it is
truly Him.”
“Why have you not told anyone? Our lord would want to know
about this.”
“He will. When the time is right. This is my prize. I found Him.
I have Him trapped. I will be the one who receives full credit for
delivering Him to our lord.”
“How many seraphim and cherubim are guarding Him?”
Luchek chuckled. “It would be most difficult to sneak into the
world and remain hidden if He was escorted by those giants, do you
not agree?”
“None? Then how many elzurim stand guard?”
“A captain, one lieutenant, and an additional warrior, plus several
more who work around the periphery and pretend to be tending to
other business.”
“Then why have you not attacked? If you have such a strong
team, you could easily overwhelm them.”

126

Luchek squirmed and fidgeted with his hands. “They wield the
flame of vengeance.”
The snake’s eyes widened. “Interesting.” He smiled.
“I have already lost one of my team to the abyss from a premature
strike. I am building up my forces and waiting for an opportune time.
Now, tell me what else you know.”
“Your time has run out,” the snake said.
“What do you mean?”
“There are men headed this way right now who seek the King.
Molech knows of their quest and will certainly be sending his own
team to investigate. They will probably be here within an hour.”
The snake slithered away toward a nearby bush.
“Wait,” Luchek said. “Are you not going to join my team?”
The snake continued without turning his head. “And face a
sword of vengeance?”
Luchek swallowed hard. An hour? That means we must begin our
attack immediately. Are we ready? Do we have enough forces?
The image of Deagos being dispatched so effortlessly by the elzur
lieutenant on the road to Jerusalem made him shudder.
I have no choice. The time is now.
One of his officers stood at his post on a nearby roof. Luchek
flew up and stood close, with his mouth next to the officer’s ear.
“Gather the other officers,” Luchek said. “Meet at our secret cave. I
have urgent news, and we must meet immediately.”
Luchek gazed in the direction the snake had disappeared. Just
then, an enormous spirit in the form of a fearsome dragon heaved
into the air on terrible leathery wings with a dreadful screech. It
headed south toward Egypt.

In his secret cave on the outskirts of Bethlehem, five demons
gathered around Luchek with anxious expressions.
“The time has come for us to make our attack,” Luchek
announced.
“Why now?” one of the officers asked.
“Molech has dispatched a team to search Bethlehem. They will
be here within the hour. If we hope to claim this victory for ourselves,
we must move now.”
The officers breathed fast and heavy, and their heads twitched as
Luchek laid out his battle plan.
“You all saw what had happened to Deagos,” Luchek said. “We
can assume the enemy still possesses that same fatal power. Avoid
direct contact with the elzurim’s blades at all costs. Through a series of
sharp swooping maneuvers, we will distract the enemy with superior
numbers and draw them away from the Child. All we need to do is
divert the guards’ attention away long enough for one of our team to
reach the Child.”
Luchek met eyes with each of his officers. “It is a dangerous
mission. A single swipe of the enemy’s sword will mark an instant
end to your time on earth. However, the glory of the prize makes the
risk more than worth it. I believe one of us will be fortunate enough
to strike the final blow that will usher in the beginning of a new
kingdom.”
They all palmed their sword handles and looked at each other
with wide eyes.
“Go brief your teams,” Luchek said. “We attack on my signal.”

room.
Elric moved next to Jesus, who played on the floor. “No word

Four beaelzurim swooped in through the roof, swords drawn,
shouting terrifying war cries. The three angels swung their swords at
the attackers, but the demons dodged and spun and shot out the back
wall. Before Elric could turn his head, a second wave flew through the
front wall. Again the angels swung their swords. Again the demons
evaded the blades and shot out the back. A third wave blasted through
without engaging.
“They are trying to draw us away,” shouted Elric. The next wave
plowed through the wall and out through the roof. “Stay close to the
King. Don’t let anyone near.”
Four more of Jenli’s team jumped into the room from behind.
Elric met them with welcoming eyes, and the seven expanded their
defensive circle outward, forming a larger buffer zone around the
Child. Another wave swooped through. For half an hour, wave after
wave swept through the room.
“Why do they not engage?” one of the warriors called out
between attacks.
Another wave crashed through.
“They fear the sword of vengeance,” Elric answered.
“None of us have it,” Jenli said.
Another wave crashed through.

“They don’t know that yet,” Elric said.
“This seems like a good time for it,” Jenli said.
Another wave. This time, one of the elzurim’s blades found its
mark on one of the more careless attackers. The surprised demon
squealed and flew away.
The attacks stopped. Every angelic eye darted toward the ceiling,
the wall, the ceiling.
A new wave burst in, drawing a little closer, and two of the
demons purposely made minor contact with their swords. They
encountered no blue flame, and they were not vanquished.
The next wave brought a few more cautious contacts.
The next wave brought more contacts.
The demons continued swooping in and out, but many of them
stayed, thrusting their way inward. Elric and Jenli’s team found
themselves embroiled in an all–out battle.
Elric struck down an attacker, bound him, and shoved him aside
with his foot. He raised his sword and blocked two incoming blades.
We are outnumbered. The skill and power of our warriors is sufficient
now, but we need more reinforcements. It’s time to send the signal.
He motioned to Jenli to take charge, and Elric bolted straight up
above the house and raised his sword high above his head. He spoke a
single word, and his sword burst forth with an intense white light. To
a human who might have eyes to perceive it, it looked like a brilliant
star. To the angels who watched for it, it became a shimmering signal
to come to the King’s aid.
With his sword ablaze as a flashing white beacon, he made a
flight across the region to call the rest of his team. He flew from the
hills of Judea and made a wide sweeping circle as far south as Egypt

n Jerusalem the three magi finished repacking their camels’
saddlebags with fresh provisions from King Herod for the
relatively short trip to Bethlehem. Balthazar began to mount
his camel but stopped and gazed into the eastern sky.
“Look at that,” he called to the other two. “What star would be
rising in the east in that position at this time of day?”
“And with such brightness?” said Caspar.
“That is no star we know,” Melchior said. “Most curious.”
The three stopped fussing with their provisions, congregated,
and stared at this interesting star. Calm, but intrigued, they stroked
their long beards and rubbed their chins.

“It’s moving!” Caspar squeaked. “Look, the star is moving!”
The other two nodded with their mouths hanging wide
open. The unusual star carved a path from the east to almost
overhead and then due south toward Bethlehem.
With a crackling voice Balthazar recited the words they had
pondered over a year ago, “‘At journey’s end . . . ’”
Melchior finished the quote. “‘The star alights above the head of
the King of stars.’”
“The King’s star!” Caspar shouted. “The King’s star!”
The three old men jumped up and down like excited young boys,
hugging each other, slapping each other’s shoulders, and laughing out
loud.
Out of breath and full of life, Melchior said, “Quickly, we must
follow it. Hurry! Hurry!”
The other two had already mounted their camels. In a fast–
moving cloud of dust, their small caravan blazed southward as fast
as the magi could drive their beasts. They covered the two–
hour walk in less than a single hour. With every step, the star
became nearer, sharper, distinctly stationary. And so the star, which
they had seen in the east, went on ahead of them until it came to a
stop over the place where the Child was to be found.

One of the defending angels at the inn in Bethlehem nicked
Luchek’s shoulder with his blade.
“Argh!”

The angel stabbed his sword into the ground, used it as a vault,
and planted both feet on Luchek’s chest. The kick sent Luchek
tumbling out of the house.
Luchek jumped back to his feet and grabbed two of his officers
about to re-enter the fight. “This was supposed to be a swift, precise
strike,” he railed. “But because of the incompetence of this team and
your lack of leadership, this is turning into a full–scale protracted
battle—one in which we’re probably not strong enough to prevail.
Look around.”
Most of his team had been pushed out of the house and now
engaged in open warfare in the air and on the ground surrounding
the house.
“But the captain’s beacon,” one the officers said. “He has called
in five additional warriors.”
“We are losing our numerical superiority,” the other officer said.
“I don’t want excuses,” Luchek shouted. “We still have them
outnumbered. And they do not have the flame of vengeance. Get our
warriors in there and penetrate the inner defenses!”

“I suppose you’re going to tell me it’s an angel.”
“Now you’re making fun of me, too?”

The magi approached the outskirts of Bethlehem. They slowed
their camels to a brisk walk. The star still shined before them and

from sprinting this final stretch.

“That looks like a battle,” the captain said.
“Somebody found the King before us,” Nangar said.
“But they haven’t defeated Him yet, or the battle would be done.”
The captain turned to his team of ten lieutenants, each a powerful
hulking brute. “Get in there. Destroy Him.”
Nangar grabbed the captain by the arm. “Are you not going to
report this to Molech?”
“After my blade cuts off the head of the Man of Flesh.” The
captain yanked his arm free and took off toward the battle.
“These warriors,” Nangar said to himself. “They know nothing
of subtlety.”
He fumbled with a sword and made a few feeble swings.
“I was the one who brought them here. I am the one who should
receive credit for finding him. I will be glorified for this victory.”
He swung his sword again and sped toward the battle.
“I will have my piece of this fight!”
Nangar approached low and fast. By the time he arrived,
Molech’s team already had the elzurim on the defensive. They pressed
them inward, and it looked like they had the superior forces. Nangar
picked the nearest defender, extended his sword, shouted, and made

held tight. He lay flat on his back with a dark warrior’s foot on his
chest. Out of the fight. How could I have been so careless? He lifted
his head and looked toward Marr’s command center where his team
had Marr pinned down. To the north, Elric’s beacon shined in the
distance.
The situation in Bethlehem must be dire. I wonder if my team has
noticed Elric’s beacon. He held his head up for several moments. There!
Five lights shot out of the command center and headed north. Good.
Another light shot upward and disappeared. He let his head drop
back down with a thud.
He strained his neck the other direction. Zaben’s stronghold is
in trouble. The power of the heavy beaelzur forces, combined with
the relentless pressure of thousands of blood–hungry demons, wore
down the angelic defenses. The outer defenses broke down, and the
middle defenses became increasingly vulnerable. More and more
assaults penetrated all the way to the inner line. It won’t be long now
before the stronghold is breached.
Timrok closed his eyes and clenched his fists.

above a house, and in the waning dusk its light illuminated that
house—and only that house—with a magical glow.
Melchior said, “If we are to believe that the God of Israel is
leading us by this star, there is no mistaking to which house it leads.”

They stepped up to the door, rather out of place in their foreign,
bright, and regal garb.
“What now? Do we simply knock?” Caspar said.
“This is why we have come,” Balthazar said. He tapped on the
door.
A young man cracked the door open, revealing only the warm
lamplight from inside.
“Yes?” the man said.
Balthazar bowed his head. “Sir, we are travelers from the far east.
We are seeking the newborn King of Israel. We have followed His star
to this place.”
The man behind the door paused a moment, looking them over,
then opened the door.
“Please come in. My name is Joseph. This is my wife, Mary.”
“You are very kind. My name is Balthazar. These are my
companions Melchior and Caspar.”
Caspar looked around at the austere single–room accommodations
and the plainly dressed young toddler on Mary’s lap, and asked, “Is
this child the One whom we seek?”
Joseph and Mary smiled at each other. Joseph answered, “I
believe so. This is Jesus. I will tell you our story and you can judge
for yourself. But first, please tell us your story and how it is that you
came to find us.”
The three retold their story as they had done for King Herod.
Joseph and Mary sat, smiled, and nodded with understanding
expressions. None of the fantastic things they said seemed to surprise
Joseph and Mary who took it all in and never showed even a hint

of disbelief. The magi finished recounting all that had happened to
them, and Joseph laughed aloud and slapped his knees.
“Yes, I definitely think you have found what you were looking
for,” Joseph said. “Now, let me tell our story.”
Joseph began from the very beginning and left out no details.
The magi sat with sparkling eyes as he told of the shepherds and
their experience with the angelic host in the heavens. They gasped
at each fulfillment of prophecy. They hung on every word, and the
excitement on their faces couldn’t be contained.
***
With Timrok’s team now in the fight in Bethlehem, Elric dove
back into the center of the fray. The room swelled with the sweet smell
of the presence of the Holy Spirit as the magi and Joseph shared their
stories, and the power of His presence gave strength to Elric’s team,
who were on their heels from the frenzied onslaught of the growing
numbers of enemy attackers. Even with my extra blade, and those of
Lacidar and Timrok’s teams plus the additional strength from the King,
it will probably not be enough. Elric shot a desperate glance at
Jesus. Why? Why would the King be willing to take on such vulnerable
flesh?
While the humans talked quietly, the chaotic melee in the
Middle Realm boiled all around them.
***
The great dragon blasted into the command structure in Egypt and
exploded in a colossal fireball of energy. The heavy black smoke

sank to the ground and rolled outward like a boiling waterfall, and
Satan emerged from the smoke, motionless in front of his throne. He
waited for Marr and his warriors to climb back to their feet.
He roared at Marr with his eyes blazing, “You fool! The Child is
not here. He is in Bethlehem! While you press this meaningless battle
here in Egypt, He has remained hidden and undisturbed in Judea.
A small band of pitiful warriors has Him surrounded, but they need
real power to complete the job. Redirect all your forces to Bethlehem
immediately!”
“But lord, I—”
“Immediately!” he blasted with more flames and smoke.
***
The battle reached a peak in Bethlehem.
Elric slashed and spun and kicked. There are too many!
The attackers pressed fatally close, and Elric now stood as the last
single point of defense for the King. He held off four raging demons,
but a demon captain slipped through and raced toward the Child.
Elric couldn’t reach him.
All time ground to a stop.
The demon raised his awful, jagged black steel high above his
head and released the most terrifying, evil screech Elric had ever
heard.
Every spirit in the room froze, and every eye turned inward—
every demon eye, wild with anticipation of sweet imminent victory;
every eye of Elric’s team, heavy with dread and bewilderment.

In the stillness of that split second, one of the magi’s voices broke
through into the Middle Realm. “This truly is the King whom we
seek.”
Another magi stood and extended his arms with his palms
upward. He bowed his head. “The God and Creator of the universe
has taken on human flesh to dwell among us”
Luchek laughed and shouted, “And that human flesh will be His
undoing! Do it!”
The demon brought his sword crashing down toward the Child’s
head.
Elric cried out, “Nooooo!”
Too late. The course of the demon’s blade could not be stopped.
This is it! The event that would forever change the entire universe.

The beaelzur blade reached the Son of Man, and an
ear–splitting crack and a brilliant flash of heavenly white

light exploded in the Middle Realm. Elric staggered backward. Blind!
I can’t see! He blinked, straining through the fog of the moment. Did
the demon truly vanquish the King? What will the Godhead look like
with part of Him destroyed? Did all that power transfer to the spirit who
crushed Him? Slowly, the blindness became a hazy white blur. Finally,
obscure forms came into focus.

All the spirits stood around the room, squinting and rubbing
their eyes.
The young Child bounced happily on Mary’s lap.
Joseph and the three magi talked calmly.
No sign of the demonic assailant. He had vanished.
“They can’t touch Him!” shouted Elric. “He is still the Almighty
King, even in human flesh, and they can’t touch Him! Drive these
traitorous creatures out of here.”
Crash! Swords collided, sending sparks sizzling through the
spiritual air. Mayhem erupted—war shouts, flashes of light, clouds
of sulfur.
Through the roof, dodging a blur of enemy swords, Grigor
burst in and alighted in front of Elric. “The time has come,” Grigor
shouted. An enemy sword sliced through the air toward Grigor’s
neck. He ducked, and Elric drove his sword over Grigor’s head and
through the forehead of the attacker.
“Yes!” Elric shouted. “Finally!”
Elric withdrew his sword. Grigor was gone. Elric smiled. Faster
than lightning, this one. Elric shot straight up with one powerful burst
from his wings to a height much higher than before—high enough
to be seen well over the horizon. With two authoritative words from
Elric’s mouth, his sword erupted again in dazzling light—this time,
blue. The signal surged across the sky as far away as Egypt.
***
Zaben hovered at the top center of the angelic stronghold in
Egypt. All around him, the circle of beaelzurim pressed their frenzied

attack. Thousands of fiery missiles blasted inward. Sparks and flashes
of light glowed through the sulfurous cloud that stretched from the
top of the stronghold dome to the ground. The cloud hung like death
in the spiritual air for miles around the stronghold and shrouded
the movements of the advancing hordes. The never–ending tumult—
shrieks, exploding fireballs, war shouts, clanging steel—climbed to a
deafening level.
The outer layers of defense had fallen. Thousands of elzur warriors
and lieutenants lay in heaps around the perimeter, bound and unable
to fight. The captains and commanders in the middle ramparts now
bore the increasing pressure, and they were being smothered by the
sheer numbers. The inner ring of generals held their line, but not for
much longer.
Zaben raised his eyes above the battle and gazed again across the
northern horizon. Come on . . . come on . . .
A general to his left fell. Two beaelzur generals, three dark
commanders, and a dozen demon warriors took hold of the mighty
angelic general. They tore at his wings, pierced and slashed him, and
immobilized every limb. He tumbled downward in the center of a
writhing mass of flames, light, and smoke.
An earsplitting shriek from the left rose above the clamor. Zaben
spun around toward the sound. There, from the direction of Marr’s
headquarters, came two additional awful shadows. Marr. Satan. Oh,
no! This is the end. We only have seconds . . .
Zaben turned again to the north. Come on . . . we can’t hold on
any . . .
A pulsing blue beacon appeared in the dark sky. Elric’s signal
from Bethlehem.

Satan and Marr reached the edge of the battle, barking orders to
call off the assault.
“Now!” Zaben shouted. “Now! Now! Now!”
Zaben’s five warriors blew a battle signal on crystal clear silver
trumpets. The pure tones rang out over the noise of the battle, and at
the sound, every angelic warrior shot straight up into the sky. Fallen
elzurim, loosed by their comrades, freed the other fallen warriors and
joined the others high above the citadel. Within a single breath’s time,
all angelic resistance from the stronghold disappeared.
Crash! The spiritual dome of the stronghold imploded. Like a
wall of water bursting through a shattered dam, the momentum of
all the attackers smashed inward. Marr and Satan tumbled in amid
the tidal wave, and their orders to pull back were drowned in a sea of
confusion and chaos.
The trumpets sounded again. In an instant, the angelic host
dropped like a curtain over the beaelzurim horde. The host formed
a new dome, this time with the enemy trapped within. The elzur
generals lined the innermost layer and concentrated their efforts on
Satan, Marr, and the enemy generals. The elzur commanders and
captains made up the middle layer of defenses. The remainder of the
warriors formed the outer shell. The entire momentum of the battle
shifted in a single instant.
Zaben hovered over the dome with a glint in his eyes. Confusion,
disarray, and shock rumbled from within the dome. It will be hours
before they realize what happened. Probably a day before they can counter
with any kind of organized attack. I hope Elric can keep his timeline
because I don’t know how long we’ll be able to keep them contained.
***

145

In Bethlehem, the surge of light from Elric’s blade subsided, and
he lowered it with a smile. He stared in the direction of Egypt. He
took a deep breath. Time is now my enemy. We must move quickly. He
glanced down at the melee below. But first, I need to separate the King
from this battle.
Grigor appeared, hovering face to face with Elric. “The King’s
position has been compromised,” Grigor said, “and none of the enemy
who knows His location can be allowed to go free.” Grigor smiled.
“‘Vengeance is mine,’ says the Lord of Hosts. Speak the word.”
Elric’s eyes grew wide. He raised his sword high above his head
and shouted, “Vengeance! Vengeance for the King!”
His words rolled up into a ball of blue light and shot up the
blade of his sword. It reached the tip, and the ball of light exploded
and surged back down. A sapphire–blue ring of glowing energy burst
from the bottom of Elric’s sword’s handle. It started as the size of
a man’s fist and shot downward and outward in an ever–expanding
disk. It swept through the air of the Middle Realm, and every elzur
blade it touched burst into intense blue flame.
Elric laughed and dove into the center of the fight.
His team came to life with renewed purpose. With the blazing
authority they now wielded, he and his team decimated the enemy
who had possessed the upper hand moments before. One by one,
they reduced the beaelzurim to wisps of dissipating sulfuric vapor.
Many of them tried to escape, but Elric’s team apprehended each one
and dispatched them to the abyss. Not since the days of the Nephilim
had so many beaelzurim been confined to the abyss in a single day.
The victory was complete and the battle decisive.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

146

One demon remained, and Elric pinned him between his
glowing blade and the blades of Jessik and Kaylar inside the room
where the battle had begun.
“Luchek!” Elric rumbled.
Luchek stood limp and trembling.
Elric’s whole body shimmered with a white–blue aura, and the
flame of vengeance pulsed and danced between the floating blade
components of his sword. He raised the blade to Luchek’s bare neck.
“You dared to try to strike the King?” He pressed his blade close, and
Luchek stretched his defiant chin upward out of reach. Elric paused.
He growled. He snapped his blade back with discipline and purpose.
“You deserve the abyss,” he said through clenched teeth. “But I
have other plans for you. I want you to bear the shame of your defeat
before your master. Report to him everything that happened here
today. Tell him the King cannot be touched. Tell him what happens
to anyone who tries.”
Elric said to Jessik and Kaylar, “Escort this traitor to Jerusalem.
Make sure he stands before Satan.”
The two shoved Luchek out of the room, and Elric turned to
Jenli. “I need you to go with them and lead this detail. Hold him
someplace hidden between here and Jerusalem for three days. Then
take him all the way into Herod’s palace.”
“Shall I walk directly into the enemy’s stronghold?” Jenli asked
with raised eyebrows.
“The flame of vengeance will remain on your swords for the
entire mission until you have delivered the prisoner. The enemy will
keep their distance. The Lord will be with you.”

A LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS

147

Jenli smiled and looked at his blazing blue sword. “In His
service.”
“Our quest has taken a new turn,” Elric said. “We now know the
enemy cannot touch the King directly. However, the sword of man is
still a threat. Now, the enemy will concentrate on working through
men. We will continue to keep the King hidden, but we must watch
for enemy movements among men.”
***
Jenli marched out of the room and left Elric alone with the
humans. For the first time since the battle began, Elric turned his
attention to the Physical Realm.
The magi filed out the front door and left Joseph and Mary alone,
looking at each other with shrugs and raised eyebrows. Moments
later, the magi filed back in, laboring under the weight of carved
wooden trunks. Joseph and Mary looked down at their feet, up at the
ceiling, over at each other, and smiled silly, awkward grins.
Elric chuckled.
Bowing low before Jesus, the three magi each opened their
trunks. The warm aroma of the spices wafted through the room, and
the gold treasure glistened in the lamplight. Joseph and Mary gasped.
Mary covered her open mouth with both hands.
“This is . . . more money than we have ever seen in one place,”
Joseph said. “We can’t accept this.”
Balthazar said, “This is our gift to the King. You would not
dishonor our service to Him, would you?”

148

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Mary put her hand on Joseph’s shoulder. Her eyes filled with
tears.
“No,” Joseph said. “Of course not. We are humbled by your
generosity and honored by your gift. Thank you.”
The magi lingered for almost an hour, taking turns touching and
holding the Son of Man, giving thanks for the amazing opportunity,
and worshiping Him as though He was literally God on earth.
Elric smiled and breathed in the wonderful fragrance of
the worship rising out of the room toward heaven. They actually
understand. Of course, He is God in the flesh on earth. He glanced
around the room—the room that was a battlefield an hour ago. He
shook his head. How is it that I was surprised by the inability of the
enemy to directly touch Him? He is still the King regardless of the form
He might take. He doesn’t need the elzurim help to protect Him physically
from these spirits. Even after all we have been through so far, I still have
much to learn about our role in this amazing plan.
He took in a deep breath and let it out slowly. The unfolding of
the great mysteries of the King made this whole adventure rich and
satisfying beyond anything he had imagined.

“Now what?” Caspar said.
“It’s too late to travel back to Jerusalem,” Melchior said.
“Shall we find a room in one of the inns?” Caspar asked.
Balthazar looked up at the stars. “No,” he said. “I think I should
like to sleep under the stars tonight.”
Melchior nodded. “The lights of heaven. I agree.”
“Under the stars,” Caspar said.

They led their camels out of town on foot at a contemplative
pace. They walked without talking, not sure how to put into words
all that stirred within their spirits. They found a suitable place outside
of town and set up camp. They didn’t erect tents but laid their bed
mats out in a row on the ground. Then they lay on their backs and
gazed at the stars.
After several minutes of silence, Balthazar said, “After all the
years of studying the stars and looking for meaning in them, tonight
the heavenly expanse seems completely different.”
Caspar said, “We saw, and touched, the very One who spoke all
those stars into existence.”
“I almost feel a personal connection with them,” Melchior said.
They each lay awake soaking up the majesty of the heavens and
thinking about the great Creator. The entire journey, starting with the
original appearance of the King’s star, had left them forever changed.
Eventually sleep overtook them and they slipped into peaceful dreams.
Elric waited there for them. He spoke to all of them in a dream,
his words floating like a sparkling white cloud over the men in the
Middle Realm. “Today the King has made Himself known to you.
Blessed are you among men. Now receive this word from the Lord—
do not return to Jerusalem and report to Herod, for he seeks to kill
the Child. Do not fear. Return to your home in peace for the Lord is
with you.” The cloud hovered over the magi until it seeped into their
spirits and flashed onto the backdrop of their minds.
He leaned down low and touched each one on the forehead.
“Receive the word of the Lord,” he said. With each touch he spoke.
“Peace. Joy. Strength.”
***

151

Elric imparted peace, joy, and strength to the last magi and
stood up straight. He opened his wings, looked back at the three
sleeping men for a moment, smiled, and flew back into Bethlehem.
He entered Joseph and Mary’s room. The lamp had been put out, and
everyone slept. Timrok’s warriors stood guard.
“Time is short,” Elric said to the team. “We need to get Jesus
out of Bethlehem before the enemy can regroup. By morning there
will surely be additional scouts from Molech to check on the status
of Nangar and the other scouts, so I need to speak to Joseph directly
in a dream. And the message needs to be direct and unambiguous.”
Elric stood over Joseph and placed his hand above Joseph’s head.
His hand began to glow. He spoke, “Get up! Take the Child and His
mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is
going to search for the Child to kill Him.”
And then, somewhere between the misty dreamlands and
consciousness, Elric gave Joseph a shake.
***
Joseph awoke with a start. Who nudged me? He turned toward
Mary—sound asleep, with her back to him. There is some kind of
presence here. He strained his eyes into the dark room. No one there
but Mary and the Baby.
What a dream. Wait. Was it a dream, or was it real?
An angel—shining white—with an urgent message. It seemed
real. As real as if the angel was standing right there. He squinted again
into the darkness. He looked different from the one I saw before we got
married. But everything else about it felt exactly the same.

152

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

He sat perfectly still, his heart thumping in his ears. He forced
himself to take slow, deep breaths.
That was real. It was more than a dream. I received a message from
the Lord.
He grinned in the darkness and rubbed the prickly bumps on
his arms.
A message from the Lord. How amazing that He would send a
messenger to tell me . . . wait . . . he said Jesus is in danger! Jesus is in
danger, and we need to flee the country immediately!
He turned to Mary and woke her with a gentle shake.
“Mary, I had a dream from the Lord. An angel told me that
Herod is going to search for Jesus to kill Him. We have to flee to
Egypt.”
Mary wiped the sleep from her eyes and mumbled, “Flee to
Egypt? When?”
Joseph jumped up and reached for his tunic. “Tonight. We need
to pack up and go right now.” His voice carried resolve, and he moved
with urgency.
Mary sprang out of bed.
“You pack in here,” Joseph said, lighting an oil lamp. “I’m going
out to hitch up the cart and pack my tools.”
Mary slipped on a robe. “Should we wake Omer and Miriam
and tell them we are leaving?”
Joseph stopped. Omer and Miriam have been so good to us—we
can’t disappear without saying goodbye. On the other hand, if Herod’s
soldiers were to interrogate Omer or Miriam, we’d all be at risk.
“No,” Joseph said. “It will be too dangerous for both them and
us. It’s best if they don’t know anything. Leave enough money on

the table to cover next month’s rent.” His tone softened. “I don’t like
leaving like this, but we have no other choice.”
It took little time to pack all their meager belongings onto the
carts and begin trudging off into the unknown darkness. Joseph
estimated they were in the second watch of the night and determined
to put as many miles between them and Bethlehem as he could before
sunrise. While Mary and the Baby slept in the back of the donkey
cart, Joseph pulled the hand cart and pressed hard down a southward
trail under a partial moon.
***
Elric walked with Joseph, giving him the physical strength to
bear the load and keep the pace swift. His words of strength and
energy penetrated Joseph’s spirit and brought vitality to his flesh. They
needed to put distance behind them—more distance than would be
physically possible for Joseph and the donkey.
He sent Lacidar and his team back to their place in Judea. Jenli’s
team stayed behind to deliver Luchek to Jerusalem. Timrok’s team
went ahead of him to clear their way. He remained the lone visible
escort. Low profile, nothing to attract attention. Even though the
enemy can’t touch the King directly, we don’t want to get caught alone in
the middle of the desert by the horde of angry beaelzurim that could be
raging toward Bethlehem from Egypt at any moment.
“Hurry,” he spoke to Joseph. “We must hasten the pace.”
The boldness of this plan is beyond me. Behind us, the anger of
an earthly king and a powerful demon commander will chase us like
wildfire. At the same time, we run toward Egypt, directly into the largest

154

confluence of enemy forces ever amassed on earth. The timing will be
critical. The success of this journey hinges on how long Zaben can keep
the enemy contained. The pressure building under the lid of the cauldron
Zaben has created must be incredible.
“Faster,” he said to Joseph. “Faster still.”
***
Morning light brought intriguing tales of nighttime dreams of
the magi. They compared their dreams, and the three wise men from
the east were amazed by the vivid reality of the visions of the angel.
And the message delivered to each of them was exactly the same.
There could be no doubt they had received guidance from heaven,
and the experience only helped to strengthen their newfound faith in
the living King. And so, having been warned in a dream not to return
to Herod, they departed for their own country by another way, full
of joy, full of faith, and full of anticipation for what the child King
would do for the world.
***
Morning light brought two of Molech’s scouts to Bethlehem.
They scoured the streets from north to south, but they found no sign
of the original team Molech had sent the day before. In fact, the
whole town seemed quiet. Too quiet.

The morning found Joseph at the end of his strength. They had
covered a good distance during the night, but he needed to stop and
rest. He parked the carts under the shade of some trail–side trees.
He set out a bucket of water and some of the barley straw from the
supply in the cart for the donkey, and they all ate under the warmth
of the morning sun.
“I am going to try to sleep,” Joseph said. “Let Jesus run around
and play. But watch for soldiers, and don’t talk to anyone who might
pass by on the trail. We need to keep moving, so don’t let me sleep
long.”
Mary nodded.
Joseph pulled off his sandals and lay down in the back of the
cart. He took a deep breath, and by the time he had let the air out,
sleep overtook him like a crashing wave.
Joseph’s eyes popped open. He blinked and squinted from the
light. He sat up and looked at the position of the sun in the sky. It’s
not yet midday. Good. I didn’t sleep too long. He hopped off the back of
the cart and looked for Mary, who he found playing with Jesus under
the shade of a tree.
“You’re awake already?” she called out. “You didn’t sleep long.”
“I feel good,” Joseph answered. “Strong, rested. I am ready to go.”
Mary folded up the blanket she was sitting on, hoisted Jesus
back into the cart, and climbed in after Him. Joseph drank from a
water skin and popped a date into his mouth. He walked over to the
donkey and stroked its neck with one hand while holding a handful
of straw in the other.
“How are you doing, girl?” Joseph said to the donkey. “Did you
get some rest? We have another long trail ahead of us today.”

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

156

The donkey munched the straw and shifted her hooves with
quick, energetic movements.
“It’s strange,” Joseph said to Mary. “After a hard night of travel,
and with so little sleep, I don’t understand why I feel as strong as I do.
My feet aren’t even sore.”
“Maybe the Lord is strengthening you,” Mary said.
“Maybe.” Joseph lifted the handles of his hand cart and pushed
it toward the trail. “We’re going to need it. I still sense we are in great
danger.”
With a constant inner urgency driving him, Joseph pressed
onward for three days. Little rest, unexplainable strength, and no
signs of Roman soldiers.
***
It had been three days since Zaben received Elric’s beacon
and trapped all of Marr’s forces within his stronghold. At first the
containment of those forces presented little challenge. The trap
had stunned and confused the enemy, and the spirit of the King
empowered all the elzur forces. Over the last day, though, the pressure
within the stronghold built, and to Zaben’s dismay, he could feel the
cloud of heavenly strength lifting.
At the center of the tangled mass of beaelzurim stood Satan, huge
and dominating with his flaming arms stretched upward. Molten fire
shot out of his mouth and hands and fingertips like lightning, and
a shroud of thick black smoke billowed around him. The bolts of
fire blasted through the beaelzurim from one to another and infused
them with unnatural strength. The generals’ fireballs became larger

FLIGHT

157

and more devastating; the dark warriors’ blades burned with red–hot
flames; and their fury blazed out of control. Instead of the chaotic
mayhem of selfish individual efforts, the bolts of fire from the dark
master brought the demons under his control resulting in more
unified and coordinated attacks. The mounting pressure could not
be contained much longer. Without direct intervention by the King
Himself, Zaben’s stronghold would burst soon.
The first of the beaelzur generals blasted through the last layer
of elzur defenses in the late afternoon. Hundreds of dark warriors
spewed through the hole. Then, under the influence of Satan, they
all uncharacteristically turned back to help the rest of their comrades
break through. The freed demons fought and clawed and peeled
back the elzurim from around the newly formed breach. More and
more of the raging beaelzurim erupted through the fissure until an
unrestrained stream of blackness exploded outward.
The dome around Zaben’s stronghold created by the tight layers
of elzurim looked like a glowing white mountain, and the demons
shot out from the top of the dome like a volcanic eruption, creating
an ever–widening hole. The eruption vomited black smoke and fire
high into the atmosphere and ripped shards of the white mountain
away from the rim of the hole. Within only a few minutes, all the vile
contents of the stronghold escaped, and a massive black cloud of evil
gathered and swirled above. The elzurim broke away from the dome
and engaged the demons in the air, but with the unconstrained sky
to maneuver through, they could not restrain the movements of the
enemy.
The last of the evil horde gathered, and the entire mass boiled its
way northward like a dark cloud.

t was almost evening at the far southern reaches of Israel
below Beersheba, and the widow Hannah puttered about in
her garden where ripe grapes hung from the arbor over the

vegetable beds. The sun sank low in the west, and a strange dark storm
approached from the south. The long black fingers of the boiling clouds
moved fast, and the silent air around Hannah’s house felt stagnant and
eerie. Hannah didn’t see any rain coming, but in the distance, flashes of
lightning illuminated the clouds from within.

She glanced to the north and saw a couple of travelers kicking up
a small cloud of dust on the southward trail. There appeared to be a

donkey–drawn cart, a man pulling another small cart, and a woman
walking beside. Hannah wondered where they might be headed and
whether they had a place to shelter from the incoming weather.
She placed a cluster of grapes next to the black radishes in her
basket.
***
Inside Hannah’s house, the regional elzur captains and lieutenants
gathered, reviewing the day’s events and discussing strategies for the
coming days. A quiet tension gripped the room. They all stared at
the war map, transfixed by the huge black cloud of evil headed their
direction from Egypt. Its final destination wasn’t clear, and they
hadn’t received any information about what they were to do about it.
For a long time they stood without saying a word and watched the
ominous horde advancing northward.
Elric appeared through the back wall. All eyes turned toward
him. He moved to the war map, rubbing his chin.
He muttered aloud, “They are nearer than I had hoped. This
is going to be very close.” He turned to the four captains. “I shall
explain more in a moment. First, I must attend to something. If I
don’t get this done right now, we will have a difficult night.”
Elric stepped out of the house and walked over to Hannah, who
had pulled the last of a few weeds that had invaded her garden. He
had no time for a dream—he would need to speak to her spirit while
she was awake. He eyed the incoming storm, took a deep breath,
turned, and spoke with a clear, strong voice.

home. They must enter your house quickly and spend the night. They
are weary from their travels and need at least a full day to rest.”
Elric’s words rolled up into a cloud of light and shot toward
Hannah. The words hit her spirit, clad in a thick layer of light. Her
armor soaked in his words like a thirsty sponge, and the message sank
deep into her spirit. Elric smiled.
The stark contrast of the two of them standing together made
Elric shake his head. Hannah looked small and frail. Her full height
barely reached the middle of his huge solid torso. In the waning
sunlight her slight frame cast a long shadow on the earth, while his
enormous mass left no shadow at all. Elric crossed his arms and waited.
The irony of this simple, single old woman, silhouetted against
the red sky with the vast storm of evil bearing down on them,
struck Elric. His words reached her spirit, but did she hear with
the ears of her heart? Would she choose to act? The course of all
creation hinged on the actions of this one lady in this critical
moment in time. Would she fulfill her role in history?
Hannah stopped, looked toward the travelers, set down her
basket, and began walking toward the trail, several paces away.
Elric chuckled. If only all humans responded like that. It would
make my job so much easier.
Hannah reached the trail before the travelers could make it that
far south. She headed up the trail to meet them.
“Hello, welcome!” she called out from a distance, waving. They
met on the trail, and she welcomed them again. “My name is Hannah.
Welcome, welcome.”

Joseph looked ragged but managed a tired smile.
“You look exhausted,” Hannah continued. “How long have you
been on the road?”
Joseph brought his small troop to a halt. “Three nights and three
days.”
“And with a baby. Good heavens, no wonder you’re tired. What
you need is a good hot meal and a bed to sleep in. Come. My house
is right over here. I will take care of you.”
Joseph’s voice sounded tired and distant. “Thank you for your
kindness,” he said, “but we couldn’t—”
“Oh, shush, shush.” Hannah stepped up close to Joseph and
turned toward the south. “See that storm? You don’t want your pretty
young wife and that baby out in the weather when that hits, do you?”
“Well . . . no.”
“And do you have a place to stay tonight?”
“No.”
“Then it is settled. I insist. You shall spend the night here.”
Elric laughed. She is good. I’m glad she is on our side. And to
Joseph he said aloud, “You should listen to her. It will do you good
to get some rest.”
Joseph looked toward the south. He gave an uneasy shudder. He
looked to Mary, who gave a shy smile. He turned to Hannah and gave
in with a grateful smile and nod.
They all walked back toward the house, but their pace was slow.
Elric checked the progress of the dark clouds. We’re not moving fast
enough. From the speed of the incoming horde, we won’t get indoors
before the enemy passes overhead.

“Keep moving. Keep moving,” Elric prodded. This is going to be
much too close.
Hannah, Joseph, and Mary looked at the incoming clouds and
quickened their pace. Joseph’s cart bumped over a rock, and several
tools spilled out of a pouch hanging on the side. They clattered to
ground. All forward motion stopped. Joseph collected his dropped
tools.
“Hurry, hurry,” Elric urged.
A clap of thunder sent them scurrying. They reached Hannah’s
garden, and Hannah stopped and turned aside.
“One moment,” Hannah called out. “I need to get my basket.”
“No!” shouted Elric. “There’s no time. We’re not going to make
it.”
“Here it is,” Hannah said.
“Go, go, go!” Elric lowered his voice, looking upward with a
grimace.
Joseph shuffled the two women and the Baby through Hannah’s
front door and turned back. “I’m going to tie up the donkey and
batten down the carts.”
The door closed as the first edge of the dark cloud passed directly
above the house. Elric looked up, let out a huge sigh, and stepped
inside.
Elric entered the room and found the entire host of elzurim on
their knees with heads bowed low. An awkward tension filled the air.
The King hadn’t told them to rise or even seemed to notice them.
Elric broke the silence. “Arise, my friends. Behold the King in human
flesh. He will not speak to you, for He is but a child of one year.”
The room burst into excited chatter.

“Incredible!”
“How is it possible?”
“Does He need to eat like a normal human?”
“After all these centuries, it’s even more amazing than I had
imagined!”
“Quiet!” interrupted Elric. He motioned to the map and pointed
his finger upward. “In case you have forgotten, we are not alone.”
A deathly hush fell over the room. They all crowded around the
map.
Elric spoke in a low whisper. “The Lord has promised He would
overshadow this place with His protection and hide us, but we must
be still and wait.”
The weight of the danger passing close overhead felt heavy in
the room as the elzurim watched the black cloud move over the map.
Several of the warriors drew their swords and stared at the ceiling.
This small group of angels was isolated and surrounded, and Elric
could see in their eyes that they knew it. They remained still and
waited. And waited.
For more than an hour the cloud of evil overshadowed their
hideout. All the while the elzurim watched the map and waited. After
the tension of the first half of an hour passed, the warriors couldn’t
help but steal glances at the young Child in the room with them.
There He was. The promise of the ages. They were in awe. They were
captivated.
They were surrounded by the enemy.

Molech’s scouts in Bethlehem stood before Satan, who bristled
with rage.
“Where is He? Where is the Child?” Satan roared.
“We do not know. Our lord, Molech, sent us here from Jerusalem
two days ago to find another scouting detail he had sent to find the
Child the day before. We have searched the entire city for two days,
and we can find neither the Child nor the other scouts. We are afraid
to return to Jerusalem without answers, so we have remained here
and continued our search.”
“This is the place.” Satan seethed, glaring at Omer and Miriam’s
inn. “He was in this house. And He was surrounded by a small team
led by a pathetic imp named Luchek. Have you seen him?”
“No, my lord.”
“Then the King’s warriors must have gotten the upper hand and
stole the Child away to another hiding place.”
Satan turned to Marr, “We will go to Jerusalem and see what
Molech knows. Have your warriors conduct a more thorough search
here in Bethlehem. Then spread out and scour all the surrounding
regions. Begin here and go north, west, and east. Go as far as a three–
days’ walk for a human. We know He has to be within that radius.”
“Shall I send any forces south?”
“No, fool. We came from the south. If He had been traveling
south, I would have surely seen Him. Give orders that if anyone finds
Him, he must report immediately to me. I will set up my throne in
Herod’s palace for now.”
“Yes, my lord.”
A loathsome black mist crept through Bethlehem that night,
seeping through every crevice and leaving a sinister chill in the air.

blazed through the windows. Timrok’s five warriors were in the

room with him. Some shuffled their feet. Most knelt. All stared at the
sleeping Child.

“A different picture from what we faced last night,” Prestus said.
“Mmm,” replied Elric, nodding his head. “I wasn’t sure we were
going to make it in time. It was close.”
Chase knelt closest to the Child. He stared without blinking. “I

Elric chuckled. “You should have seen the looks on the faces of
the regional captains and lieutenants last night.”
Elric listened to the deep breathing of the sleeping humans and
folded his arms. “This is good. They needed this rest. We will stay
here at least a day. It’s a safe place for them to regain their strength for
the rest of the journey. Now I have a new task for you five.”
The warriors jumped into a smart line. They stood at attention,
but their eyes kept glancing back toward Jesus. Elric smiled.
“Go find Zaben at the Egyptian palace. Gather him and his
team. Then make a search for Timrok. It is my hope that he is only
bound at the battle site and not carried off to captivity. If he is under
guard, free him. Then bring them all back here.”
“In His service,” the team responded in unison. They turned and
filed out of the house.
Elric took a deep breath and soaked in the peaceful quiet. They
still had far to travel, but this was a welcome stop.

In the field south of Nazareth, the morning came with peaceful
stillness as Levi and Daniel watched the sun come up over the flock.
It was one of those quiet, contemplative mornings—when the soul
melds with the warming red glow and the mind searches for truth.
“Tell me more about the Messiah,” Daniel said.
Levi leaned back on his elbows. “You are thinking of your vision
again, aren’t you? Very well. The Messiah—Moses tells us he will be
a great prophet.”
“What does a prophet do?”

“Tells about future things. But mostly, he hears directly from
God and speaks His word to the people.”
“Have you ever seen a prophet?”
“No. There has not been the voice of a true prophet in Israel for
400 years.”
Daniel sat with his chin propped up in his hands and watched
the orange horizon turn yellow.
“Hmm. What else?” Daniel asked, staring off into the sky.
“We know the Messiah will be a great healer. He will make blind
eyes see, deaf ears hear, the lame will—”
“Could He heal my ear?” Daniel turned to see Levi’s face.
Levi didn’t flinch. “Of course. He’s the Messiah.”
“He sounds wonderful.” Daniel leaned back on his elbows.
“What else?”
“He will bring peace to Israel.”
“How?”
“By defeating all our enemies.”
“You mean the Romans?”
“All our enemies.”
Daniel sat up. “Will He raise up an army?”
“I suppose He will have to.”
“Will we be able to fight in His army?”
Levi smiled. “If your vision is true, and the Messiah was born a
year and a half ago, I suppose we will both be able to.”
Daniel jumped up and grabbed a stick. He slashed it through an
imaginary battle. “Won’t it be great—you and I, fighting side by side,
behind the Messiah, crushing the Roman army?”

The morning in Herod’s palace came with anything but peace.
Satan set himself up in Herod’s throne room, and a flurry of spiritual
activity buzzed throughout the compound. The soaring ceiling and
tall, majestic marble columns lining the vast room seemed more
fitting for the regal black throne than the shambled ruins they had
left in Egypt, and this new seat of power pulsed with energy. The
commanders stationed throughout the room issued orders to their
captains, and a never–ending swarm of messengers shuttled in and
out. Molech stood to the left and behind the dark lord’s throne,
centered in the room and lifted high on a platform of billowing black
smoke. Molech stood in silence after the berating barrage of rebuke
he received during the night. He crossed his defiant arms and glared
at the one who had trumped his place of power. Marr stood to the
right of the throne and overcompensated for his failure in Egypt by
barking an endless stream of orders to all his commanders. His words
burned with anger, and he threw insults and blame at his officers like
poisoned knives. The wounds deflected off of the commanders to the
captains, who passed them on to their warriors. The upheaval in the
throne room created a boiling torrent of malice that spewed out of
the palace compound in every direction.
Into this seething darkness three unlikely forms in glowing white
marched.

170

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Jenli led the detail with his sword held at arm’s length in front of
him, the special blade formed by Timrok ablaze in scintillating blue
flame. With his chiseled chin set with determination, his bright eyes
darted about, pinpointing every potential threat. Behind him walked
his prisoner, Luchek, whose arms and torso had been shackled with
glowing white cords of pulsing energy. Luchek’s head drooped low,
and his eyes revealed the dread of his upcoming fate. Behind him
walked Jessik and Kaylar, bright and shimmering. They, too, carried
blazing swords held out for all to see. They prodded their prisoner
along, eying their surroundings and turning around as they walked.
The brazenness of this march had exactly the effect Jenli wanted
to see. The moment they entered the outer palace grounds, every
demon along their path stopped and looked. With faces of gaping
disbelief, each demon would reach for his sword—but then spot
the flaming swords of vengeance and jump back out of reach. Jenli
continued his march with purpose, never slowing or turning.
Jenli drove deeper into the enemy’s stronghold, and the numbers
of beaelzurim grew. Hundreds surrounded them on every side. In
front of him, a group of dark warriors formed a wall, blocking his path.
He pressed forward, and the masses gave way. They closed in around
them, keeping a safe, but threatening, distance. Jenli approached
the main palace. Hundreds of hulking demons lined the roof ’s edge
like grotesque living gargoyles, and thousands more swarmed in
and around the building. He clenched his jaw and held his sword
up high.
After what seemed like an eternal march, Jenli and his team
entered the main throne room of the palace. The room fell silent,
and every sinister eye turned toward the trespassers. The commanders

all held their palms upward, holding blistering red fireballs of energy
that grew and pulsated while preparing to be unleashed. Every other
beaelzurim in the room prepared their jagged blades for battle. The
one on the throne sat—unmoved, unimpressed, and unthreatened.
Without a word he waited for Jenli to approach his throne. Once
Jenli reached the foot of the throne, he stopped and peered with an
icy stare into the deep emptiness of the eyes of the dark traitorous
cherub.
Satan broke the silence. “So, Lieutenant, have you and your army
come to send me to the abyss?” His words dripped with pompous
deprecation.
Jenli stood firm. “May the Lord rebuke you.” Stepping to the
side, he said, “I have come to deliver a prisoner.”
The two warriors pressed Luchek forward and his shackles
disappeared with a silent flash. Without another word, Jenli turned
and walked between Jessik and Kaylar toward the other side of the
room where they had entered. He passed the two, and they did an
about face and followed two steps behind. All three still held their
blazing swords, but now they held them outward and pointed slightly
down as if to say, “Our work here is done.”
Every fiber of Jenli’s being wanted to shoot straight up
and disappear into the air, but he determined to walk out of this
stronghold with all the dignity by which he had entered. So, he and
his team marched out through the back wall without looking back and
continued through the courtyards past the marble colonnades and
thousands of enemy forces. Their pace remained slow and deliberate.
Once they reached a place well outside the palace compound, they
took to the wing and shot northward in case they might be followed.

As they flew, their swords flickered for several seconds, and then
the brilliant blue flames went out. Jenli watched with disappointment
as the power receded, and with reluctance he returned his cold steel to
its scabbard. The other two followed suit with sad smiles.
Jenli pushed his sword into place and laughed. “Wouldn’t you
love to have been able to stay and watch Luchek get interrogated?”
“Not I,” replied Kaylar. “It is not going to be pleasant.”
***
“You had Him! You had Him, and you let Him get away!” Satan
suspended Luchek in mid-air with his massive hand wrapped around
Luchek’s throat. He shook Luchek like a limp rag doll and flung him
across the room accompanied by a blast of fire from his fingertips.
Luchek flailed out through the back wall. Satan snorted a puff of fire
and smoke from his nostrils.
“Go get him and bring him back,” he growled.
A moment later, two commanders carried Luchek into the
throne room. Each had a hold of one arm, which left Luchek’s feet
dangling well above the floor. Satan regained his chokehold. Luchek
dangled before him.
“How could you let Him get away?” This time he waited for an
answer.
“They all were empowered by the flame of the vengeance on
their swords. We had no chance against them.”
“Of course your puny little team had no chance. And yet, you
knew His location for over a year! You had plenty of chances to tell
me! But instead, you squandered our best opportunity.”

He shook Luchek again and gave him another fiery fling. The
helpless form careened out the back wall again, and Satan gave
another snort and rolled his eyes.
“Bring him back again,” he muttered.
With Satan’s grip around Luchek’s throat again, the grilling
continued.
“Tell me everything about the battle. Did you see Him? What
did He do? Were there cherubim?”
Luchek scowled and gave a defiant sneer. “The battle was going
very well, as a matter of fact. There were no cherubim. In fact, a
captain was the strongest of their forces, and we had them on the
defensive. Then, I personally fought my way into the house and saw
the Child. He looked like any normal human child. He didn’t seem
to notice us. I don’t know if He could even see us. Like I said, the
battle was going very well for us. One of my team was able to fight
his way past the defenses and reach the Child.”
“He actually reached Him?”
“Yes, I saw the whole thing . . . all the way up until the moment
his sword struck the Child.”
The throne room became dead silent.
“What happened?”
“There was a blinding flash, and then my warrior was gone.
Instantly to the abyss.”
“An elzur struck him?”
“No. There were no elzurim even near him. It was the contact
itself. The Son of Man cannot be touched. I think even the angelic
captain was surprised. He shouted something to his team and
disappeared. Seconds later every one of the elzurim had a flaming

sword, and it was all over for us. As far as I know, I am the only one
left. The captain spared me so I could come back here and relay the
whole story to you. He wanted you to know that even though the
King has human flesh, we are not able to directly strike Him.”
Satan roared. Fire exploded from his mouth and hands. The fire
filled the entire room. The larger, stronger spirits shielded their faces
and eyes until the firestorm subsided, but the smaller spirits were
blasted from the room with the flame’s front wave. Luchek still hung
suspended in the dark lord’s left hand.
“Where did He go?” Satan demanded through clenched teeth.
“I . . . do not . . . know,” Luchek gasped through his constricted
throat.
The fire exploded again. Satan shook his ragdoll again and gave
him another toss. This time, after the fire settled, he didn’t send for
Luchek to be retrieved.

erod and several of his attendants and officials attended to
the morning business of state in the throne room. Herod
pounded his fist on the armrest of his throne as one of

his officials received the brunt of his discontent. Herod had a sharp,
angry headache, and the very air he breathed felt laden with vexation.
He looked around the room, and it appeared everyone else also had edgy
nerves. Every thought and action seemed to take extraordinary effort.
He had already received several reports of bad news and was threatening
his official with his life when a centurion entered the court and requested
an immediate audience with the king.
175

“Your highness,” the centurion said, “I bring news from the
field.”
Herod snapped back, “It had better be good news. I have had
enough bad news already this morning.”
“The detail of soldiers you sent to Bethlehem the day before
yesterday did not find any signs of the magi from the east.”
Herod gave a disgusted “Hmmph.”
“However, I am glad to report that one of my scouts on the
eastern border spotted them crossing it yesterday. It appears they
headed south initially and then turned east. They have departed Israel
and are headed back to their own country.”
“Did they find what they were looking for?”
“I do not know, sir. We did not make any contact. Shall we
pursue them?”
“No. There would be no value in that. Thank you. You are
dismissed.”
Herod tapped the armrest of his throne. The magi must have given
up on their quest and went on their way—which means the newborn
King they thought had been born was nothing more than a delusion of
their eccentric eastern mysticism. They were too ashamed to return and
face me.
He returned to railing his errant official.

Satan sat back on his throne and thought out loud. “It seems
that even though the King has the mortal flesh of a man, we are not
able to touch him directly.” He tapped his talons on the high twisted

armrest and continued his thought. “However, He is the Son of Man,
and as such is subject to . . . ” He paused and turned to Marr. “We
have been misguided in our approach. Instead of trying to attack
Him directly, we should be trying to reach Him through men.” He
shot a sinister glance toward Herod. “And I have the perfect man.
With a single word from this mortal king, I can unleash a wave of
destruction at the hands of men that will destroy the Son of the King
of Heaven.”
Every foul spirit in the room erupted in a frenzy of morbid
approval.
“War?” asked Marr. “Shall I send word to Rome and partner
with Herod to obliterate the nation of Israel once and for all?”
Satan raised his hand to quiet the roar of excitement in the room.
“No, that would take too much time. We need to act now before
the elzurim can move Him out of reach. I prefer a more directed
strike. The Son of Man is only a child.”
The roar of approval at the thought of killing babies erupted
even louder.
Molech stepped forward. “But, my lord, I’m not finished with
Herod yet. A move like this would surely spell political disaster for
him. I don’t think he could recover from it.”
“I care nothing about this man’s political future,” Satan said. “I
need him now, and you have him prepared for my purposes.”
“But he—”
A wall of flame from an upraised hand from the throne stopped
him short.
Molech started again. “Then, could I—”
This time Satan’s hand went up as a cautionary warning.

“Would you grant me permission to destroy Herod myself?”
Satan laughed. “After today, he is all yours. You have done well
with this man. I commend you for your work, and I am happy to
grant your request. Strike him with a consuming plague. Eat him
alive from the inside. Make it as painful and horrible as you like, and
extend his agony for as long as you can. After today, his services in my
kingdom will be complete.”
With a dramatic flair of regality, Satan stood up from his throne,
spun around with a flourish and stepped down toward Herod, who
sat on his own lesser mortal throne. Anticipation charged the air in
the Middle Realm. Satan stood before Herod and swiveled around
again. Then, without a word, Satan sat down and disappeared within
the flesh of the man.
***
Herod continued castigating his failing official, when something
occurred to him—a thought, strong and vivid, almost as though
someone spoke directly to him.
What if the magi did find what they were looking for?
He stopped his verbal barrage and took up this new train of
thought.
Why else would they have left the country so soon? If they spent
months traveling to Israel seeking some newborn King, they certainly
would not have given up in one day’s search after getting here. The only
explanation is that they did find Him!
Herod looked around at his subjects who stared at him with
puzzled expressions. He announced, “Leave me. I need a few moments.”

A CRY IN RAMAH

179

The king now sat alone with his thoughts.
That has to be it. The magi actually found the newborn King. That
means they intentionally avoided returning here to tell me. They tricked
me! They have made me the fool! They have made a mockery of my throne.
The rage exploded within him. The audacity of these men from
the east made his head spin with uncontrollable hatred.
I must pursue these insolent heathens and kill them for this injustice!
No. Wait. There is a larger issue. If they found what they were
looking for, that means a new King is out there—one who will someday
challenge me for my throne.
On top of the hatred that already blazed within him, that old
familiar paranoia about losing his power erupted like a pressurized
volcano.
I must kill this King before He can grow up and become a threat.
Yes, I must kill Him. But how will I find Him?
I know the magi were headed to Bethlehem. If I scour that city and
all the surrounding areas, I should be able to find Him.
And how will I know who He is?
I know he is less than two years old based on the date that the magi
said they saw the star. I should simply kill every Israelite male two years
old and younger. I cannot afford to take any chances.
Kill babies? I can’t do that. The people will be outraged. I would
certainly lose favor.
Perhaps, but think of the favor this King will draw to Himself as he
grows. Right now He is an unknown. If I do not eliminate this problem
right now, He will surely bring down the entire kingdom.
I can’t allow that. This must be done. What reason shall I give for
such an order?

Ha! I am the king. I owe no reason to any man. I will simply
accomplish the task and not offer any reason. I will strike quickly and
silently, and the entire campaign will be complete before the people even
know what happened.
“Attendant,” Herod called out. One of his attendants entered.
“Send for the Primus pilus immediately.”
The attendant nodded once and disappeared. The throne room
remained quiet until the massive door to the court swung open
again and the senior centurion of the Roman legion in Jerusalem,
commander of the first cohort, entered with crisp, disciplined steps.
Herod’s thoughts of late regarding this commander had been
dark and treacherous. He suspected the chief soldier might be
planning a coup, and this mission would be a perfect opportunity to
test the centurion’s loyalties. If he executed the king’s orders without
question, he would be allowed to live. If not . . .
***
The Primus pilus crossed the court toward the throne, and Marr
moved to the place where he anticipated the centurion would stand.
He stood there and looked into the eyes of his master—hidden behind
the eyes of Herod—and smiled a wicked calculating smile. Within
a few more steps the centurion reached the foot of the throne and
stopped in the exact space Marr occupied. Marr smiled again, closed
his eyes, and with an uplifted chin disappeared within the man.

The chief centurion felt a chill and became gripped with fear. He
had heard rumblings about Herod’s growing distrust of him, and it
occurred to him as he looked around the empty room that a private
meeting with the king might mean the worst. He knew the irrational
ruthlessness of the king, and a mortal dread washed over him like
none he had ever experienced, even in battle. He stood with all the
stoic courage he could muster and awaited the words from the king.
“I have an urgent and vital mission for you,” Herod said.
The centurion breathed an unnoticeable sigh of relief. “Yes, my
lord.”
“The nature of the mission requires utmost secrecy. You may
select up to twenty of your most trusted soldiers, and you must tell
no one of your business other than those on your squad. Can you do
this?”
“My duty is to serve the king,” the centurion answered without
hesitation.
“I need you to go to Bethlehem, search every house, find every
Hebrew male two years old and younger, and kill them. Then, expand
your search into all the surrounding districts, destroying every Hebrew
boy under two years of age.”
Within only a few pounding heartbeats, a flood of thoughts and
emotions crashed through the centurion’s head.
Kill young children? Why would he want to do that? This is even
more irrational than usual. This is a test. He is testing my loyalty. I must
obey the order. But babies? The role of a Roman soldier is to fight enemies
of the state. And if I do not carry out the order?
The fear for his own life gripped him again and bent his will
until it snapped.

If the king desires it, these young boys are enemies of the state. If I
have to kill each of these enemies myself, I will see to it that every one is
found and none is left alive.
Without any emotion or hesitation, the centurion repeated his
previous response: “My duty is to serve the king.”
“Good,” Herod said with a satisfied tone. “Select your men
quickly and make haste to Bethlehem today. I have reason to believe
He may already be . . . I mean, there may be some who may already
be fleeing from your sword. Make a swift end to your business in
Bethlehem and move into the surrounding areas. There is no time to
spare.”
“I will return by the end of this week with a thorough report of
our success.”
With a curt bow, the centurion marched across the court and
left the king alone again with the low thud of the thick wooden door.

Satan stepped out of Herod and gave orders to twenty of the
surrounding beaelzur captains to move ahead and select twenty men
whom they could indwell and to arrange for them to be ready for
Marr to select through his human shell, the centurion. He turned to
Molech and with an obliging wave of his hand indicated that Herod
again belonged to him. Molech nodded once, stepped forward, and
took his rightful place within Herod.
Herod’s anger still boiled, and Molech reveled in the caustic
energy. After several minutes of letting Herod simmer in his thoughts
of paranoia and rage, Molech decided he wanted to demonstrate his

Herod’s jumbled thoughts came into focus. I should go visit
Mariamme. She always knows how to make me feel better. I know she
will tell me I did the right thing.
Herod rose from the empty expanse of the throne room and
slipped out a back way to the secret inner room where he knew his
love would be waiting.

lric stood with Grigor in the corner of the room at Hannah’s
house for a private conversation early the next morning. Grigor
spoke with a low and solemn tone. “And you may divert a

measure of your team to save as many as possible, but know that you
cannot save them all.”

“In His service,” Elric said.
“By His word.” Grigor disappeared through Hannah’s ceiling.
The humans in Hannah’s house started to stir for the day,
but Elric’s full attention turned to the war map and the activities
unfolding there. A large black cloud rose out of Jerusalem and moved
184

toward Bethlehem. Elric shook his head with one hand half-covering
his eyes. Unthinkable horrors moved across the map. There would be
no stopping the wave of destruction about to wash over the Judean
countryside.
He looked over at the young Jesus who still slept, unaware of the
importance of the escape they had made, and Elric couldn’t help but
let slip a small, bittersweet smile—and a large tear.
***
Joseph and Mary laughed as Hannah played with Jesus on the
floor of Hannah’s house. The midmorning sunshine filled the room
with a warm glow, and Elric watched the energy of their laughter
bounce off the earthen walls and dance about the cluttered room
before floating upward toward heaven. He breathed it in and chuckled.
If Lacidar was here, he would have a lively tune to play.
He pictured the young Child fully grown, crowned with glory,
vanquishing His enemies, and establishing His throne on the earth.
He closed his eyes, raised his hand, and directed his own lively tune
with a smile.
In the middle of Elric’s second chorus, Zaben and Timrok
stepped into the room through the front wall.
Elric turned with a hop and shouted, “Zaben! Timrok!”
Elric spoke the word “joy” into his hand, and a ball of energy
formed. Timrok spoke “peace” into a ball of energy. The two smashed
their orbs of light together with a blinding flash. They laughed as
shards of peace and joy filled the air in the Middle Realm. Elric and
Zaben exchanged joy and faithfulness.

186

Elric put his hand on Timrok’s shoulder and said, “It is very
good to see you.” He turned to Zaben. “Both of you.”
“Was there ever any doubt?” Timrok said. “I was . . . ” His gaze
bypassed Elric to Someone else.
Zaben already saw Him. Zaben and Timrok both stepped
forward and dropped to their knees. Their eyes grew wide, and their
mouths hung open. Timrok drew his two swords and laid them on
the floor.
“I forgot,” Elric said. “This is your first opportunity to see Him.”
The two stared without responding.
“Zaben, your team has yet to see Him. Are they outside?”
Zaben nodded with his mouth still open.
“I’ll bring them in,” Elric said with a smile.
Elric returned with both Zaben and Timrok’s teams. Each team
formed a line along different walls. They knelt. And stared.
Elric let them soak it all in for several minutes. Then he said,
“You have been wondering what the King would look like wrapped
in the body of a one–and–a–half–year–old human? Well, here He is.”
All the angels stared at the humans in the room.
Jesus was hiding under a blanket.
“Where did He go?” Hannah called out in a singsong voice. “I
can’t find Him anywhere.”
Giggling came out from under a wriggling blanket.
“I know He has to be around here somewhere.”
More giggling.
“Peek-a-boo! There you are!” Hannah lifted the blanket and
found Jesus bright-eyed and laughing. Jesus leapt from his “hiding
spot” and bounded into Hannah’s arms.

Mary laughed. “Now you have to give Him lots of kisses. It’s
part of the game.”
More giggling, more laughing, more kisses, and some wrestlingkind of hugs.
“He wants to be found,” Mary said as the young Boy squirmed
in Hannah’s arms. “It’s His favorite thing of all.”
Joseph nodded and said, “It’s true . . . He will hide under
that blanket and wait. Of course, He is hiding in plain sight, but
sometimes it seems like He would wait all day. And His reaction is
the same no matter how long it takes. More than anything, He wants
us to find Him.”
“He loves it,” Mary said.
“It’s almost as if that is what He lives for,” Joseph said.
The weight of their words hit Elric like an unexpected avalanche.
He slumped his back against the wall and sank to a sitting position
on the floor.
“It’s more than what He lives for,” he breathed to his companions.
“It’s who He is.”
All the angels continued staring in silence.
“I could stay and watch Him all day,” Zaben said.
“All day!” Elric yelped. “Oh, no.” Elric jumped up and moved to
the center of the room. He motioned with his hand, and the war map
appeared. “Gather around,” he said. “Quickly.”
Elric pointed toward the black cloud moving from Jerusalem.
“The enemy is on the move. Herod has issued a decree to kill every
Hebrew boy under two.”
Timrok slid his swords back into their sheaths. “Then we will
stop them,” he said.

188

Elric shook his head. “No. Their numbers are too great. We cannot
stand against this army, and that is not our primary mission. But we
have the Word of the Lord to save individuals. Go to Bethlehem and
the surrounding regions. Find the young boys. Rescue as many as you
can from the hand of the enemy.”
Timrok and his team shot straight up through the roof.
Elric caught Zaben by the arm. “Go first and tell Jenli. He should
be in Bethlehem. His team should join the mission.”
Zaben nodded.
“And leave two of your warriors here with me to serve as guards
and messengers.”
Zaben motioned for Emms and Lorr. They stepped forward
with their hands on their hilts.
“Good,” Elric said. “Now, go in the power of the Spirit.”
“In His service,” Zaben said.
Zaben disappeared through the roof, followed by his remaining
three warriors.
Elric turned to Lorr. “Go to Judea and warn Lacidar. I don’t
know if the enemy will extend that far, but if they do—the prophet
John is in danger.”
Elric looked at Emms. “Stand watch in a concealed position
outside. You will be my eyes while we remain here.”
In a matter of seconds, Elric found himself alone again. He
motioned with his hand, and the war map dissipated into a mist. He
took a deep breath. He turned his attention again to activities of the
humans.
Jesus was hiding under His blanket.

SAVING SIMON

Birth plus 16 months, Day 1 of Herod’s edict

T

imrok stood outside the house of Jonah, a small earthen home
in a tiny village a short walk northwest of Bethlehem. With arms
crossed he lifted his eyes toward Jerusalem. The darkness churned

and rose high into the sky above the horizon over Jerusalem and rolled
southward toward Bethlehem. In the Middle Realm it looked like a
slow–moving Saharan dust storm—an unstoppable wall of turbulent,
gritty blackness with a hunger to choke the life out of everything in its
path.

By the time the sun climbed to its noontime zenith, the cloud
reached Bethlehem and began its siege. Timrok closed his eyes, and
189

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

the battle played out in his mind—efficient Roman soldiers moving
from house to house, driven by forces they didn’t understand, or even
knew existed, carrying out the will of the one on the dark throne.
The valiant elzurim in the city, doing their best to stand against the
beaelzurim, but unable to stave off the torrent.
He groaned and opened his eyes with a furrowed wince, knowing
what he would see next. A shower of elzurim lights descended from
heaven to escort the newly released innocent spirits of children into
the presence of the King. For these young ones, their earthly pain was
over; but for their parents, this was a pain that would cut them for the
rest of their lives. The resulting bitterness would open new inroads
for the enemy in their lives. He palmed his sword handles and gritted
his teeth.
The sadness of the King fell down like a chilling mist, and Timrok
found himself unable to hold back the tears. Streams of sorrow rolled
down his hard face.
Ten thousand battles, and the pain never gets easier. One day. One
day the King will put an end to this pain.
His mind drifted back to the Promised One back at Hannah’s
house.
One day very soon.
Through tear–stifled eyes he watched the distant battle for hours.
He didn’t count the escorts from heaven, but the number was far too
high.
The cry of an infant from inside the house behind him brought
him back to his task at hand. Timrok spun around and stepped into
the house.

SAVING SIMON

191

The cries came from Andrew, tiny, pink, and bundled. His
mother, Joanna, held him close and nursed. Andrew settled down.
His older brother, Simon, bounced around the room with a makeshift
toy, lost in his own toddler world. Timrok smiled.
Timrok shot uneasy glances at his team. “They will be here
soon,” he said. “First the beaelzurim scouts. Then the men on foot.”
All five of his warriors drew their weapons.
Timrok drew his swords. “But with the help of the King, they
will not claim the sons of Jonah. Take up your stations.”
The warriors spread around the perimeter of the room and
disappeared within the walls. Timrok moved to the center of the
room, crossed his swords in front of him, and took a deep breath.
Timrok stood like a silent stone statue. After a short time, a
small, wiry demon darted into the room through the side wall. His
hungry eyes trained in on the two boys. Like a flash of lightning,
Timrok swatted the demon with a single stroke of his blade and sent
the enemy crashing out through the front wall.
“The boys were seen,” Timrok called out to his team. “But I
think your positions were not compromised. We will do battle today.”
Several tense minutes passed. The front door burst open. Timrok
flinched. Jonah scuffled in with a small cloud of dust and a day’s
worth of weariness on his shoulders. Simon met Jonah with a squeal,
bounded across the room, and vaulted as high as his tiny legs could
spring. Jonah caught him in mid-flight, scooped him up to eye level,
and buried his scruffy bearded face into Simon’s neck amid more
squeals. The young family enjoyed a light and cheerful moment, but
Timrok stood on edge. Darkness approached.

192

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

After a short time, a loud, persistent, impatient rapping on the
wooden front door interrupted the pleasant atmosphere. Timrok
swallowed hard. Jonah barely had the latch released when two burly
Roman soldiers pushed their way through the threshold into their
small room. One of the soldiers carried a traditional Roman spear with
its piercing wedge–shaped iron tip. The other had a broadsword—
double-edged, simple, efficient. Both had leather footwear straps
wound around their stout ankles and blood–stained leather bands
around their wrists. In this domesticated family environment, the
soldiers looked larger than life and fiercely intimidating.
Even in the face of all this muscle, Jonah shouted, “What are you
doing? What is the meaning of this?”
The soldiers’ eyes appeared dark and distant, empty and cold.
The one with the sword answered, “I need to see all your
children.”
“Why? What for?”
“I have special orders from the king. Are these two your only
children?” he said, pointing the tip of his sword at the two young
boys.
Timrok spoke to the two beaelzurim within the men, “You are
not going to take these without a fight.”
The two demons jumped out of the soldiers’ bodies and landed
in front of Timrok. They were both lieutenants, at least as powerful
as Timrok.
One cackled and took a swing at Timrok. “Pitiful fool.”
Timrok blocked the blow and shouted, “Now!”
Timrok’s warriors stepped out of their hiding places brandishing
their shining steel.

SAVING SIMON

193

Prestus and Chase lunged toward the demon nearest them.
Nalyd and Kylek pounced on the other. The demon tried to backflip
away from Nalyd and Kylek, but Micah thrust his sword upward
in mid-jump. His blade caught the front of the demon’s shoulder
and penetrated out the back with an explosion of yellow smoke. The
demon screeched and fell to the floor. He clawed for his dropped
sword, but Nalyd and Kylek bound him before he could regain his
strength.
Timrok turned to see how the other battle progressed. Prestus
had his foot on the back of that demon’s neck, and Chase finished the
bindings of light at the demon’s feet.
“Very good,” Timrok said. “Now we can deal with these soldiers
without enemy interference.”
He turned his attention back to the Physical Realm.
“Yes,” Jonah said, “these are our only children. What is this
about?”
The soldier with the sword stepped forward. “I need to know
their ages and whether they are male or female.”
Little Simon backed against the front of Jonah’s legs. He wrapped
one arm around his father’s leg and buried his face in it.
Jonah answered with a low and guarded tone. “This is Simon.
He is just over two years old.” Then, pointing toward the tiny bundle
in his wife’s arms, “That is his new brother Andrew. He is almost three
weeks old.”
The soldier with the sword eyed Simon and without a word moved
toward him. Timrok stepped in front of the soldier and stretched out
his hand with a stiff arm. Within another step the soldier ran into
Timrok’s hand and came to an abrupt stop. The soldier cocked his

194

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

head, as though trying to understand why he stopped. He stood for a
moment, looking confused.
Timrok said, “This one is too old. You have no authority to take
any over two years old. You should move on to another place.”
Timrok’s words rolled up into a ball of light and shot toward
the soldier’s chest. His spirit had a thick layer of black armor, and
Timrok’s words bounced off without penetrating his spirit.
“He is too old,” Timrok repeated.
This time a splinter of light slipped between the cracks of the
soldier’s personal stronghold. The soldier rubbed his brows.
“You have no authority to take one this old,” Timrok said.
Another splinter penetrated. The soldier stretched a crick out of
his neck and bit his lip. He looked down at the young boy cowering
between his father’s legs. He took a step back. He lowered his sword.
He stretched his neck again and glared over at Andrew.
He pointed his sword at Andrew and gave orders to the other
soldier.
“Take him.”
The other soldier leaned his spear against the wall and moved
toward Andrew and Joanna. Jonah jumped across the room and flung
himself onto the soldier’s back, wrapping him up in his arms. The
two struggled for a moment, but other soldier struck Jonah on the
back of the head with his sword handle. Jonah crumpled into a pile
on the floor. Joanna screamed. Simon cried. The soldier grabbed for
Andrew, but Joanna held him with all her might. The soldier pulled
hard. He couldn’t pry the baby away. Timrok had his arms wrapped
around both the mother and the baby. The soldier stepped back and
rubbed his forehead.

SAVING SIMON

195

“Come on,” barked the other soldier. “What’s the problem? Take
the boy so we can finish here.”
The soldier stepped back up and doubled his efforts. He pulled.
Joanna wailed. Simon continued to cry. Timrok lifted his right leg
and placed his foot against the soldier’s chest. Right as the soldier
heaved as hard as he could, Timrok pried his fingers away from the
baby and gave the soldier a solid kick. The soldier flew backward out
of control and smashed his head against the opposite wall and fell
unconscious.
The other soldier roared. Leading with his sword he approached
Andrew and his mother. “Have it your way. If you will not release
him, I shall run you both through.” He drew his sword back. Then
with a battle yell, he thrust his blade forward.
Timrok stood between him and Andrew, and in a split second
Timrok clapped his hands together, catching the advancing blade
between his palms. For the second time in this house, the soldier
found himself unable to complete his stroke. He pulled his sword
back. He thrust it forward. Timrok caught the blade.
The soldier stepped back and let the tip of his sword swing down
until it hit the floor. His face contorted with pained confusion.
Timrok spoke again. “This one is so young. He couldn’t possibly
pose any threat to the king. You would be justified to let this one go.
Take your other man and move along.”
The soldier looked down at the woman, sobbing uncontrollably.
“Mercy. Mercy. Mercy,” Timrok repeated.
The balls of light from Timrok’s words hit the soldier in rapid
succession.

Prestus knelt beside Jonah. He extended his hand over Jonah’s
head. A layer of blue light glowed in his hand. He lowered his hand,
and the light diffused into Jonah’s spirit.
Jonah opened his eyes and rose to his knees. He swayed and
reached for the wall. He used the wall to climb to his feet, and his
hand brushed against the spear leaning there. He grabbed it and
pointed the tip at the back of the soldier with the sword. Jonah’s hair
was matted with blood, and he looked awkward handling the weapon
of war, but he stepped forward and pressed the tip against the soldier’s
back.
“Drop your sword,” Jonah demanded. “Drop it now or I will
kill you.”
The soldier’s head slumped forward. He let his sword fall to the
ground.
“Now get your partner and leave my home.”
Without another word and moving in slow, unthreatening
motions, the soldier shuffled across the floor to where his partner still
lay by the wall. He picked up a small pitcher of water on a nearby
table and tossed its contents into the face of the unconscious soldier,
who opened his groggy eyes.
“Come on,” the leader of the detail said to his reviving partner.
“There is nothing here for us. We should move on to another place.”
The two soldiers made their way out the door, and Timrok
addressed their demon escorts. “You have no place here. These boys
will not be your prey today. And see for yourself—neither of them is
the One you seek. Be gone from here.”
Chase cut the bindings of the demons. They screeched and shot
out through the front wall.

197

It took all evening for Jonah to calm his family down, even with
the help of Timrok. Finally, after the children had gone to sleep,
Jonah said, “This is the final stroke. We cannot continue living under
the shadow of this madman, Herod. What reason would he have for
wanting to kill our boys? We need to get away from here. We need to
get far away from Jerusalem. Maybe his influence will not be as strong
the farther away we get.”
“But where?” Joanna said. “Where would we go?”
“To my brother’s house in Bethsaida by Galilee. Maybe we could
get a fresh start there. He is a fisherman. He could teach me the
trade.”
“We should do it,” she said. “I am too afraid to stay here.”
Timrok crossed his arms and smiled. “Simon and Andrew. I
wonder if our paths will cross again someday.”
***
In Hannah’s house, Jesus clutched His blanket and drifted off to
sleep. Hannah moved the lamp to the other side of the room, and the
late evening shadows settled in over Jesus. She came back and tucked
the blanket around Him.
“He sure seems to like his blanket,” she said.
“Yes,” Mary answered, “it’s a blanket we found in the stable the
night He was born.”
“A stable?”
“It’s a long story. But He has had that blanket from the beginning,
and He loves it. Not only does He like to play peek-a-boo with it, but

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

198

He carries it everywhere and likes to wrap Himself up in it, especially
when we’re outside.”
Hannah fingered the edge of it. “The material is so smooth and
soft, not coarse and scratchy like the linens I’m used to.” She worked
it in her hands. “And yet, it seems sturdy and durable.” She paused.
“You know, there is probably enough material here . . . ” She stopped
short.
“What?” Mary said.
“Oh, nothing. I’m sorry dear, I am always thinking practically.
But it is not my place.”
“No, please, go ahead. What were you thinking?”
“Well, it’s no wonder He likes the blanket so much. The material
is simply heavenly. I think it would make a marvelous outer garment.
See, if you cut the material right about here, you would have enough
to make Him a little tunic which he could wear all the time and still
have a little left over for him to keep as a small blanket.”
“Hmm,” Mary said. “That’s a good idea. I believe He would like
that. He practically wears it now as it is. I will have to do that once
we get settled someplace because right now I have nothing to work
with.”
“You know, dear, I would be happy to do it for you right now.
I have everything we need, and I am experienced with a needle and
thread.”
“You have been so kind to us.” Mary smiled with her head tilted
to the side. “I couldn’t ask you to . . . ”
“Oh,” Hannah said with a dismissing wave of her hand, “I love
doing projects like this.”

199

Mary snuck the blanket away from Jesus, and Hannah went to
work, seated next to the lamp.
“This has been an excellent day,” Joseph said. “We needed this
rest. And your hospitality is greatly appreciated.”
Hannah held her stitching up close to the lamp for inspection.
“The pleasure is all mine. I enjoy the company. And I love having
little ones in the house.”
“It’s so peaceful here,” Joseph said. “I feel safe. It’s hard to
describe. And restful. If it’s not too much of an imposition, might
we stay another day? We still have a long journey, and another day of
rest would—”
“Of course, of course, dear. Stay as long as you need.”
Hannah finished the tunic, and Mary replaced the now–small
remnant of the blanket back over Jesus and kissed Him on the
forehead.
Mary whispered, “I’m excited about His new tunic, but I wonder
if He will be upset about how small his favorite blanket has become.”
Hannah rubbed Mary’s back like a grandmother would and said,
“Maybe he won’t notice.”
With the day well spent and all the work completed, the adults
said goodnight and put out the lights.
Hannah lay awake half praying and half listening. An energy
filled the air, and she could sense it. She heard no voices in her ears,
but somewhere deep within her spirit she could “hear” very distinctive
excitement, expectation, and reverence.
There is something special about this family. In particular, this young
boy is more than he appears to be.

Z

aben watched the morning sun peek over the eastern horizon
from the tiny settlement of Kerioth. Here in southern Judea
at a distance just beyond the previous day’s reach, one of the

death squads would pass through his post first thing this morning. His
team had spread out over the region to try to save as many as possible.
He stood alone in Kerioth. The little village had dozens of children, but
only one boy under two—Judas, the son of Simon. Zaben stood outside
Simon’s house and considered his plan. An operation of brute strength
was out of the question. He smiled and bit his lower lip.
200

SAVING JUDAS

201

Know your enemy. And know your charge. Victory does not always
require strength of force.
The soldiers would surely be working across a well–planned grid,
and his plan hinged on the assumption that their grids would overlap
to ensure no holes in the coverage.
It is time to set up.
He stepped into the house of Simon Iscariot. At eighteen months
of age, his son Judas would be a prime target for Herod’s men. Zaben
took stock inside the house. The whole family still slept.
Zaben walked into the back room and found Judas sleeping next
to his mother.
“Sleep,” he spoke into the air. “Sleep.”
His words spread out into a sheet of light from wall to wall and
settled like a blanket over everyone in the house.
“Sleep,” he repeated.
He moved over to Judas. “Good morning, young one,” Zaben
said. His hand glowed. With it he touched the back of Judas’s head.
Judas’s eyes popped open. He sat up, looked around, and patted
his mother. She didn’t respond. Judas bounced up and rummaged
about the room. He found a toy and played with it on the floor.
“Out here,” Zaben called from the other room.
Judas dropped his toy and ran out to the front room.
Zaben reached into the Physical Realm, lifted the door latch,
and let the front door sneak open ever so slightly. The energetic light
beaming through the open door caught Judas’s attention and drew
him toward the exciting world outside. In less than two snores from
his father, Judas escaped outside and exercised his freedom as fast
as his little legs would carry him. Zaben smiled, pushed the door

202

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

shut without latching it, and flipped his wings once to take to the
air and catch up with his young charge. As he reached Judas, Zaben
translated in the Physical Realm as a large, brilliant butterfly, full of
blazing red and bold yellow and orange colors.
He flittered in front of Judas and spoke into the spirit. “Catch
me! Come, little one—try to catch me!”
The excited young boy squealed with glee and began the chase.
Zaben bounced on the winds until he reached a low branch of a tree
where he alighted, batted his enticing wings, and waited for his young
hunter to catch up. When the tiny hands were within reach, Zaben
hopped back into the air and weaved an erratic path out of Judas’s
reach while singing a lilting melody: “Fol–low me . . . catch me . . .
looook at how pretty I am.”
Zaben continued this dance all the way down the streets until he
reached the village’s well. There, he alighted atop the low stone wall
around the well and waited again. Judas chased him all the way to the
edge of the well’s boundary. Zaben sat on top of the stone perimeter,
just out of reach—right on the inside edge of the well opening.
Judas reached, but the height of the wall touched below his armpits,
which left his stubby arms stretched out on top of the wall inches too
short. With a combination of hoisting with his arms and scrambling
for niches in the stone wall with his feet, he crawled to the top of
the edge. He laughed when he saw the butterfly there waiting for
him. Judas perched in a precarious position on the wall and reached
out to catch his prize. As he leaned forward, Zaben took off again
and fluttered downward slightly into the dark hole. Off balance,
Judas reached a little farther and fell headlong into the opening of
the well.

SAVING JUDAS

203

He didn’t fall far. Zaben met him there, not as a butterfly, but
as a strong protective angel of heaven, and he supported Judas in his
arms and descended to the bottom of the well. Zaben cradled him
there above the surface of the water and sang a quiet song of peace
and warmth in his own angelic tongue. Judas sat motionless with
eyes wide. He patted Zaben’s cheeks with his little hands and fingered
Zaben’s lips as he sang his soothing song.
***
The village of Kerioth rested in quiet stillness but for a few birds
welcoming the rising sun that morning. There was no one on the
streets. No one to see a young boy disappear into the town well.
In the home of Simon Iscariot, Judas’s mother woke up.
Judas is already up. What mischief is he getting into?
She hopped up and examined the room. She huffed once and
moved to the main room. Nothing. She let out a tired, exasperated
sigh, picked up her pace and stepped into the third room. Nothing.
She raced back to the first room.
“Judas!” she called. “Judas, come out from your hiding place.”
The rest of the family woke.
“Come on, Judas. Mama is not playing. Where are you?”
“What’s the matter?” Simon asked, wiping the sleep from his
eyes.
“I can’t find Judas anywhere,” she answered with a rising pitch.
“He has to be here somewhere. Judas?”
***

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

A two–man team of Roman soldiers trudged up an old dirt
path into the town of Kerioth. The grid plan called for Kerioth
to be their first stop of the day, and the house of Simon Iscariot
would be the first one they would check for any young Hebrew
boys. Their chatter along the road had been light and almost
jovial, but as they approached the town, they became serious,
intense, and grim. Their duties required them to be razor sharp, and
their attention heightened with every step.
***
Inside the house, Judas’s mother screamed, “The door latch.
Look! The door latch is undone!”
She pulled her frazzled hair back out of her eyes and cried.
“I know I latched the door last night before bed,” she said. “And
there is no way he could have opened it. He can’t even reach it.”
She went pale and cupped one hand over her mouth. Her eyes
widened. She brought her other hand up, cradled her face, and said,
“Somebody must have broken in during the night and taken him!”
“That’s ridiculous. Why would anybody—”
“It’s the only explanation. He isn’t here, and he couldn’t get out
the door by himself!”
She threw the front door open and was about to scream Judas’s
name when she spotted two Roman soldiers coming from around
the side of the house toward the front. With complete abandon she
rushed the nearest soldier and screamed, beating on his chest plate
with her bare hands. “Where have you taken him? What have you
done with my son? You barbarian pigs! Where is he?”

205

The other soldier grabbed her arms from behind and threw her
to the dirt at the feet of Simon. “You would do well to keep better
control of your woman,” he barked at Simon. He drew his sword.
She struggled back to her feet, but Simon held her beyond sword’s
reach. She continued her accusations and hysterics. People emerged
from nearby homes and craned their necks toward the commotion.
The two soldiers stepped back.
“It appears one of the other teams has already been through
here,” one soldier whispered to the other.
“I agree, and from the looks of things, this could get out of
control for us quickly. I think we should move on to the next town.”
“Agreed. We should go.”
The two soldiers slipped off and disappeared over the hill.
Simon struggled with his panic–stricken wife as a small crowd of
neighbors gathered.
“What is it? What’s going on?”
“Judas is missing,” Simon said.
“Those barbarians took him!” Judas’s mother screamed.
“We don’t know that,” Simon said. “He has to be around here
somewhere. We’ll find him.”
“They took my baby!”
“We’ll help search for him,” one of the neighbors said.
“We’ll all look. We’ll scour the entire village and the surrounding
areas.”
A search party formed. Judas’s parents sobbed and clung to each
other at the entry of their house, and a group of twenty searchers
fanned out over the town. With the sun all the way up now, dozens of

loud voices shattered the quiet of the morning, calling out the name
of Judas.
***
Zaben heard voices approaching.
“Judas! Judas, where are you?”
Zaben smiled and looked into Judas’s eyes. He stopped singing.
He stopped glowing. Then, still supporting Judas, he descended into
the water. For the first time since entering the well, the water reached
as high as Judas’s back. He let out a startled yelp. He thrashed and
cried and struggled to stay out of the cold water. His cries became
screams. His piercing wails echoed up the round stone walls of the
well and blasted out into the morning air.
One of the searchers ran to the edge of the well.
“Judas?” he yelled down into the darkness. “Is that you?”
A frightened cry echoed up from below.
“I think I found him!” the man called out. “Over here at the
well. He has fallen into the well!”
A crowd gathered around the well. Judas’s parents came at a full
run.
“How are we going to get him out of there?” one of the bystanders
said. “He’s not strong enough to hold on to a rope, and it’s too tight
for one of us to go in after him.”
“Judas,” the voice of Simon called from the top of the well,
“Everything is going to be okay. I’m going to get you out of there.
Just hang on.”

SAVING JUDAS

207

Lowering a large wooden bucket used for drawing water up from
the well, Simon called down again, “Judas, I need you to try to get
inside this bucket. Can you do that for me? Here it comes.”
Judas shivered and pushed the bucket away.
“Get into the bucket,” the voice called down from above again.
Zaben put his hand on Judas’s back. “Peace,” he said. Zaben’s
hand glowed, and he touched Judas’s back. “Peace.” Zaben lifted
Judas to waist level. “Little one, it’s time to go home now. Let me
help you up.”
Zaben lifted Judas farther and helped his pedaling little feet into
the bucket and guided his hands to the rope.
Simon inched the bucket upward, and his words echoed down
the shaft. “I can’t believe he was able to get into the bucket! And
somehow I think he’s hanging on.”
Zaben steadied Judas until he ascended within arm’s reach of the
top. One of the helpers caught a hold of his little wrists and vaulted
him up into the daylight and into his mother’s arms. She cried even
more.
Zaben stayed with the family the rest of the day, speaking words
of peace and restoration and watching for any signs of the enemy. The
enemy never reappeared.
The conversation between the adults that evening contained a
mixture of grateful relief and sullen reflection.
“Why do awful things like this have to happen?” Judas’s mother
said. “Do you realize how close we were to losing our son? I thought
we had lost him.”
“I suppose we should be thankful it turned out like it did,”
Simon said.

208

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“I know, but still . . . why did it have to happen at all? What
possible purpose could something like this serve? If God truly cared
for us, He would protect us.”
Zaben could only smile and nod his head. How many times over
the centuries had he listened to conversations like this?
Simon shrugged. “I don’t know. Sometimes I think things
happen for no reason. There is no ‘why.’ One thing I do know is that
we need a better latch on that door.”
“And,” his wife said, “we need to watch more closely for those
heathen Roman soldiers. I still say they had something to do with
it. They had guilt written all over their faces. And did you notice the
way they . . . ”
Zaben spoke more words of peace and faith, but they couldn’t
penetrate through the wall of pain and bitterness. The conversation
spiraled downward. He stepped outside and surveyed the surroundings.
The black cloud had long passed beyond his post and now stretched
out into the outer reach of Herod’s edict. I wonder if the enemy will
press farther tomorrow or if they will start heading back to Jerusalem. I
will need to keep a close watch to make sure Judas stays out of sight in case
the enemy passes through on their way back.

orning came early for Hannah, who had spent most of
the night hours trying to understand the stirring she felt
in her spirit. She rose before everyone, but soon the first

rays of sun woke Jesus. He toddled around the room, touching this,
investigating that, but then settled on a patch of sunlight on the floor
and played with His blanket. Hannah smiled and took another sip of
water from her cup.

Mary opened her eyes and sat up. She reached over and woke
Joseph.
“Good morning,” Hannah said.
209

210

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Good morning,” Mary said, wiping the sleep from her eyes.
Mary let out an unexpected yelp and jumped to her feet.
“What’s the matter?” Joseph asked.
Mary snatched Jesus’ blanket and held it up above her head until
the bottom of the blanket hung above the floor.
“Look at this!” she called out to Hannah and Joseph. “Look at
how big the blanket is! Didn’t we cut this down to almost nothing
last night?”
Hannah and Joseph froze. Hannah looked toward the tunic she
had made, and her mouth dropped open. She fetched the tunic and
brought it over to the blanket that Mary inspected, flipping it front to
back and top to bottom. They compared the material. Joseph joined
the inspection.
“The fabrics are identical,” Hannah said.
Mary nodded. “This is definitely the same blanket.”
Joseph gasped and dropped into a chair. “It is a miracle!”
“It’s as big as it was before we cut it, maybe bigger,” Mary
squeaked. She flipped it back and forth.
Hannah felt like she would explode. “What is going on here?
Who are you? And Who is this little Boy? I get the feeling there is
much you haven’t told me. Where did you say you are going?”
Joseph fidgeted, his eyes darting around the room. “We didn’t
say . . . so you are sure that is the same blanket?”
“It’s the same blanket!” Hannah squealed. “It is an honest–to–
goodness miracle is what it is—like one out of the Scriptures! And it
happened right here in my house!”
She pulled up a chair and parked it in front of Joseph. “My heart
has been on fire since the moment you came into my house, and

it has something to do with Him,” she said, pointing toward Jesus.
“What do you know about Him that you haven’t told me?”
Joseph and Mary looked at each other with resigned eyes. Mary
nodded to Joseph.
“I can’t tell you where we are going,” Joseph began. “For your
own safety, it is best that you do not know.”
“Why? are you in some kind of trouble?”
“No . . . I mean, yes . . . I mean, no, it’s nothing like that.”
“Maybe if you start from the beginning,” Mary said.
Joseph took a deep breath and sat back in his chair. “We don’t
tell everyone about all this. We do not fully understand it ourselves.
And not everyone would actually believe it.”
“Try me,” Hannah said.
So Joseph and Mary told about their journey from the very
beginning—the initial messages from the angel, Elizabeth and John,
the pregnancy, the birth, the shepherds, the prophets in the temple,
and the magi. The whole tale took most of the morning and continued
over the top of all the daily necessities. Meal preparation and eating
and baby playtime and napping—all happened like blurred peripheral
motion as the amazing story unfolded.
Hannah looked over at Jesus who napped on a pallet beside the
wall. “The promised Messiah,” she said. “I knew there was something
about Him.”
She sat on her hands and shook her head. “Yesterday I touched
Him and played with Him like any other young toddler. How is it I
am still alive? No one can see the Lord and survive.”
“He has become like one of us,” Joseph said. “There is much we
do not understand.”

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

212

“The Holy One of Israel. Here in my house.”
“There is more,” Joseph said. “After the magi visited, I had
another vision of an angel who warned us that Herod was seeking
to kill Him and that we needed to flee immediately. We left in the
middle of the night and ran for three full days before reaching here,
barely taking time to sleep. I don’t know if Herod’s soldiers will come
down this far, but if they do, I still think it is best if you do not know
where we are going.”
Hannah pursed her lips and nodded in agreement.
“And we should leave first thing tomorrow morning. You have
been very gracious to us, but for our safety—and yours—we need to
continue our journey until we reach the place the angel instructed
us.”

In the pre-dawn stillness, the vigilant sentinel Lacidar stood on
the eastern side of Zacharias and Elizabeth’s home. His eyes locked
on the wall of darkness that had halted for the night beyond the
horizon. The sun would be up soon, and with it would come renewed
movement of the enemy. The big question—which direction will the
movement take? Lacidar’s team gathered—first Stephanus, then Kelsof
and Ry, then BaeLee and Jaeden.
Without changing his gaze, Lacidar spoke in a low tone. “If they
continue to expand outward, we will need to take action to protect
the prophet John. Even though he is just over two years old, given the
bloodlust of the enemy, we can’t take any chances.”

MOVING ON

213

“What is your plan?” Stephanus asked.
“A simple Clarkan maneuver.”
The team nodded.
“I will lead Elizabeth out with John on a picnic into the hillsides.
If the enemy draws too close, one of you use a pack of wolves to drive
the two into a cave. I will stand at the opening and provide both a
hiding place and protection. Once the danger has passed, send the
wolves away, and I will bring John and Elizabeth back home.”
Lacidar focused again on the darkness to the east.
“Unfortunately, we do not know the intentions of the enemy.
They have expanded to the full extent of Herod’s orders, so they
should turn back to report on their campaign.”
“On the other hand,” Jaeden said, “the one on the black throne
in Jerusalem would have the men press to the ends of the earth.”
Lacidar nodded.
Kelsof stepped forward. “Sir, shall I infiltrate the enemy’s camp
and ascertain their intentions?”
Lacidar smiled. “It is not necessary. I prefer patient vigilance. We
will know soon enough.”
***
The orange glow of the sun sneaked over the horizon as Joseph
finished hitching the cart to the donkey’s harness. He hoisted an
overstuffed pack of provisions from Hannah onto the back of the
cart. He loaded the last of the full water skins to the cart. Hannah,
Mary, and Jesus emerged from inside the house.
Mary lifted Jesus onto the cart. “He loves the new tunic,” she
said.

214

“It’s big on Him now, but He’ll grow into it,” Hannah said with
a smile.
“I’m sure He’ll wear it all the time.”
Joseph gave Hannah a hug and a kiss on each cheek. “Thank you
again for your kindness.”
“You thank me? You have given me the greatest blessing of my
life. My eyes have seen the salvation of Israel.”
“The blessing has been ours. Besides being a well-needed place
to rest, your home has felt like an island of peace amid an ocean of
danger and unknown.”
Joseph looked off down the long path leading south.
“Being out in the open again,” Joseph said, “I feel vulnerable.”
Jesus bounded back and forth on the cart and hung His arms
over the edge. He laughed and bounded back to the other side.
Hannah chuckled. “I believe the Lord will protect you.”
Joseph hugged Hannah again. Then Mary hugged her.
“Blessings to you.”
“And to you.”
Then Joseph lifted the handles of his hand cart and headed
toward the trail. Mary led the donkey. Jesus laughed and waved. They
walked a brisk pace, but not as urgent as it had been at the beginning
of the journey. They still had a very long way to go.
***
The light of daybreak spread over Lacidar and his team at
Zacharias’s home. Lacidar held his breath. The black cloud churned
upward and turned east toward Jerusalem.

MOVING ON

215

Lacidar exhaled a long sigh. “And the Roman death squads are
returning home.”
The rest of the team sighed with him. They smiled to each other
and nodded.
Lacidar said, “Today, instead of trying to out-maneuver the
enemy, I believe I shall enjoy a picnic in the hillsides with a mother
and her son. You may return to your posts.”
Lacidar watched the darkness recede. He reached for his resonar.
He plucked a slow, sad melody. The resonar strings moaned. He hung
his head and whispered a new song:
“The tide recedes
The tide recedes
Like an ocean wave spent on the helpless beach
The black tide recedes
Leaving behind
The hopeless foam
The cracked shells of lives
And the hungry scavengers
The tide recedes
The black tide recedes”

On the evening of the fourth day of Herod’s edict, Daniel
reclined at the dinner table with his family. Jeremiah sat at his fatherly
place of honor with his boys around him and Ruth serving. Levi and
Daniel sat at Jeremiah’s left, but Jesse’s place to the right remained
conspicuously empty. Daniel’s eyes shifted back and forth from his

father and mother, and he held his breath through the silence. As
Levi passed Daniel the hot loaf of bread, Jesse bounded through the
door and caused a stir. Daniel bit his lower lip and waited with a
grimace.
“You are late,” Jeremiah said. His voice rumbled low and gruff.
“Yes, Father. Please forgive me. I have come from town. A runner
arrived with important news from Judea.”
Jeremiah replied without looking up. “This news must be very
great to keep you from your responsibility to your family.”
“Yes, my father. I’m afraid it is most dire.”
Jeremiah stopped chewing and looked up at Jesse.
“It is Herod,” Jesse said. “He is killing all the male children
under the age of two.”
Jeremiah and Levi gasped. Ruth dropped a ladle.
Jesse continued. “The soldiers started in Bethlehem and are
expanding out from there. At the time the messenger left, the soldiers
had extended outward a two–days’ reach. We don’t know how far
they will go.”
Ruth suppressed a sob with her hand over her mouth. She shook
her head muttered behind her hand, “He is a madman. Is there no
end to his evil?”
“What do we do?” Levi asked.
“Our family is safe,” Jeremiah said, “but we must warn everyone
we know. There are many friends here in Nazareth with young
children. They must go into hiding.”
Jeremiah rose from his place and reached for his sandals.
“Why doesn’t God do something?” Daniel said.
Jeremiah paused and looked at Daniel with a blank expression.

Daniel said, “If He truly cared about us, why does He let this
happen?”
Jeremiah stared for another moment. Then he reached for his
cloak and the lamp. “Jesse, you come with me. Levi, you come, too.
Daniel, you stay here with your mother.”
Ruth stood behind Daniel and ran her fingers through his hair
as the others left.
“Either God isn’t real, or He doesn’t have the power, or He’s mad
at us,” Daniel said.
“Shush, shush,” Ruth said, patting Daniel’s shoulders. “There is

lric sat on the back of Joseph’s cart with his feet dangling off.
Timrok walked beside. Elric’s keen eyes scanned the horizon
toward the north.

“The afternoon grows late,” Elric said. “Still no word from Jenli.
Surely by now the soldier death squads should be getting close to
Jerusalem. It is unclear what news the beaelzurim from the field will
bring to their master. Will Satan think he has succeeded?”
“Captain, a warrior approaches from the south.”
Elric turned. A light blazed toward them over the southern
horizon mere feet above the ground.

“I think it’s one of my team,” Timrok said.
Prestus came to an instant stop next to Timrok and set his feet
on the ground. His wings folded away. Elric jumped to meet him,
and the three warriors walked behind the cart.
“Captain,” Prestus said, “there is a caravan ahead that you will
overtake before nightfall. There are two beaelzurim traveling with
them and a small troop of Roman soldiers.”
Elric rubbed his chin. “These soldiers . . . do they know anything
of Herod’s edict?”
“No sir. I do not believe so. They are traveling with merchants
and a cash box. It appears to be strictly commercial.”
“I don’t like it,” Elric said. “Is there another route we can take?
Or could we divert the caravan?”
“Not through this region. The nearest alternate route we could
use is at least another twenty miles away.”
“I don’t want to slow Joseph down,” Elric said. “However, I also
do not want any unnecessary entanglements with the enemy.”
They continued walking without talking. Elric looked toward
the heavens. Perhaps Grigor will come with directions from the Throne.
They walked farther. No word came.
“The Lord did say we would be operating with little direction,”
Timrok said.
“Mmm,” Elric said. They walked farther.
Elric lifted his chin and furrowed his brows. “Then we shall
overtake the caravan and pass by. As long as the enemy does not
recognize the King, we should be safe. Timrok, send word to the
others along the route to be prepared to intervene if events turn bad.
Keep a low profile—we don’t want to attract any attention.”

“In His service.”
***
With smart determination and sharp disciplined steps, the
Primus pilus marched into Herod’s throne room. Herod dismissed
everyone else from the hall.
Alone with Herod, the chief centurion announced with a
commanding voice, “Your highness, the task delivered to me has been
accomplished according to your orders.”
“Very good,” Herod said without smiling. “You are sure that you
reached every target within a sufficient distance of Bethlehem?”
The centurion approached the throne and unrolled a scroll
containing a map. The map had a blood–red circle scribed around
the extended region of Bethlehem. A meticulous grid overlaid the
circle with Bethlehem at the center.
The scroll crinkled as the centurion pressed his finger across it.
“Each of my teams was assigned sectors on this grid. And notice how
there are overlapping regions along the sector edges. This entire area
was fully covered. Their search was methodical and exhaustive, and I
am confident that every potential target was found.”
His words marched forward with sterile, businesslike calculation.
He continued, “Each of the teams has reported in with a detailed
accounting, and every one reports complete success. Would you like
to see the overall numbers?”
“No, that will not be necessary.”
The centurion bowed his head.

“In fact,” said Herod, “I would like for you to destroy your report
and any other materials related to this mission. Neither you nor your
men—nor I—shall speak of this matter again.”
“Yes, sir.”
“You have done well, and I commend you for your expeditious
and thorough handling of a . . . delicate . . . situation. We can all rest
easier knowing the kingdom is secure.”
“Thank you, sir. By your leave . . . ”
Herod gave a rolling gesture with his right hand, and the Primus
pilus executed an about face and marched out of the court.
Herod remained pensive for several minutes before returning to
the day’s schedule. Had they found—and destroyed—the promised
Messiah King? He had no way to know for certain. His head told him
it would have been impossible for the Child to have slipped through
his net. Something deep inside, though, couldn’t be sure.

Satan sat on his twisted throne lifted high upon the billowing
smoke in Herod’s palace, and he crossed his arms. Marr stood to his
right and snapped a whip of fire over the heads of his underlings.
“Silence!” Marr shouted. “Silence.”
The entire entourage of warriors from the mission clamored
toward the throne, each one shouting about his individual success
on the mission. The Middle Realm in Herod’s court filled with a
writhing mass of pushing and clawing and elbows and shouts.
“Silence!” Marr roared again with a crack of the whip.
The frenzy continued.

Marr shouted above the din, “Captains, remove all these warriors
from the court. We will hear their reports one by one.”
The captains cleared the room of all but the senior beaelzur
officers—local commanders and generals from other regions and
their staffs. A captain ushered in the first warrior from the field. He
stood before the throne like a triumphant drunkard, giddy with the
blood of the innocents.
“I am happy to report, my lord, that the Child King has been
destroyed,” the warrior said. “I personally found Him and led my
men to His location. Then by my own hand, I used the men to strike
the Son of Man.”
“How do you know it was Him?”
“First of all, I could clearly discern His Divine nature within the
flesh. So, I knew immediately that it was Him.”
Marr held up his hand to stop the rapid–fire report. “How is
it that, in the initial sighting of Him by Luchek, His glory was not
visible?”
The warrior snarled and puffed yellow smoke from his nostrils.
“I saw it.”
“And then?” Satan said.
“Then, when the soldier’s sword struck the Child, there was a
huge explosion of light.”
The warrior looked around as if expecting exalting approval of
his great victory. Instead, every eye remained incredulous, every face
unmoved.
Satan blinked once and asked in a monotone voice, “Where is
the body?”

SIFTING LIES

223

The warrior’s gaze shifted to the ground, and he shuffled his feet.
“The body . . . vaporized in the flash of light.”
Satan looked over to Marr.
“Next,” Marr announced. “Bring in the next one.”
The second warrior from the field sauntered in with cool
composure. Confident and strong, he stepped into position before
the throne and gave a curt bow of his head.
“If the previous warrior told you he destroyed the Son of Man,
it is a lie. For I alone have accomplished this.”
“Carry on,” Marr said.
“It was the sixth house I visited in Bethlehem. A young couple
of the correct age and lineage with a single son of the correct age.”
“Did you see the Spirit of God within him?”
“Not until I struck him.”
Satan and Marr shot glances at each other and nodded.
“When my human soldier ran him through with his sword, his
sword exploded. The blood itself became light and everything else
turned dark. I presume you saw the darkness fall?”
“We did not,” Marr said.
“What happened to the body?” Satan asked.
“I watched the body slowly fade into nothingness while the
mother held Him in her arms. She screamed in ultimate soul anguish
and physical pain because, as His blood on her hands disappeared, it
scorched her skin, leaving her with permanent scars. It was the King.
I am sure of it.”
Marr nodded. “And after you killed the King, you continued on
to the next house?”

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

224

The warrior smiled, revealing his stained crooked fangs.
“Of course,” said Marr. “Bring in the next.”
***
Marr had a tired, discouraged countenance after hearing so
many unverifiable reports. He took a deep breath and droned another
question. “And after you killed the King in a blinding flash of light,”
Marr said, “what happened to the body?”
“My team of man-soldiers was transporting Him back here for
my lord, when a beam of light shone down from heaven onto the
body and whisked it away. There was nothing I could do.”
“That will do,” Marr said. “You are dismissed.”
Turning to the one on the throne, Marr said, “That was the last
report from the field, my lord.”
Satan tapped his talon on the armrest of the throne. “Every one
claims to have killed the King. None can produce a body. Only one of
these accounts can be true, if any. These are all most likely fabrications
of glory–hungry deceivers.”
He chuckled to himself.
“I am surrounded by a host of self–serving liars. Truth is obscured
by a veil of pride.”
He took his scepter in his right hand, stood up, and paced in
front of his throne.
The scepter served as an awesome and overt symbol of power,
and Marr eyed it with both fear and disdain. Its length spanned three
quarters of the height of the dark cherub in his current form—black,
crooked, and pulsing with malevolent energy. Its tip came to a razor–

SIFTING LIES

225

sharp point with the shape of a single dragon’s claw. The crown of the
staff formed the shape of a large macabre human skull with grotesque
ram horns that protruded downward and twisted together with the
hundreds of tangled serpent shapes that formed the tapered staff.
The skull looked like translucent black onyx with a perpetual fire
burning deep within, and the eyes glowed with living hatred. Every
time the staff lifted and touched down on the smoke–covered floor, it
produced a low–pitched thud like the rumble of distant thunder. The
room became silent but for the thudding of the staff.
“I do not believe the Son of Man has been destroyed,” he said.
“I would have expected to have seen a disturbance in the heavens,
an earthquake, darkness, something. I have observed nothing at all.
Furthermore, there is no body. With a body, I could wrap Him in
death and keep Him there while I ascend to the High Throne. As it
is, even if He was killed, we have lost the leverage we needed by not
having the body. Therefore, we have no choice but to proceed under
the assumption that He is still alive.”
“What is our next move, lord?” Marr asked. “Shall we intensify
our search for the Child?”
“Your search will be fruitless,” Satan growled. “The King has
hidden the Son of Man from us, and He will not reappear until His
time. Everyone should continue to watch for Him and for any signs
that might point to His location or time of His revelation; however, I
believe our best chance to destroy Him as a baby is passed. Continue
to be vigilant. Perhaps through a misstep of his human parents or the
elzurim, another opportunity may present itself. We still want to find
and destroy Him before He reveals Himself to mankind.”

Satan spun with a flourish at the end of one of his pacing paths
and raised the point of his scepter over the small crowd of generals
and continued with his orders, directing the clawed end of his staff
individually at each in passing.
“We know we must reach Him through the hands of men. Begin
raising up powers and individuals to oppose Him. Weaken the faithful
in Israel and strengthen the divisive religious. I want unprecedented
sickness and oppression. If the Son of Man plans to raise up an army
to try to strip my kingdom from me, I want Him to find nothing but
shambles of broken men and a wall of well–prepared opposition.”
Pointing to a half dozen generals in particular, he said, “Bring
in your forces from the other regions of the earth. This is a critical
time, and your operations elsewhere are secondary. Other than the
diversion in Egypt, it appears the King has chosen to hold the level of
elzur forces in this region constant, so with our increased numbers,
we should be able to have our way.”
One of the generals shouted from the back of the assembly, “And
who is to be prince over this region? After what happened in Egypt,
surely you do not intend on letting Marr . . . ”
Marr formed enormous fireballs of plasma in each hand and
shot them at the general. The general deflected both with the palms
of his hands, sending the shards of energy and fire into the smoky
atmosphere. Satan laughed and raised his hand to Marr.
“And who should take his place?” Satan said. “You?”
Marr laughed a mocking laugh. The rest of the room remained
stone silent.
Satan raised his hand up to Marr again and warned him with
his eyes. “No, Marr shall continue to maintain his authority here.

227

He is most familiar with the human powers in play, and I need that
knowledge during this time.”
Marr’s smug demeanor standing next to the throne drew the
hisses of the other generals. Satan turned and stepped toward Marr,
his eyes burning like red–hot coals.
“Actually, Marr’s miscalculation in Egypt is precisely why I want
to keep him in place. The disgrace of his failure shifts the leverage of
power back to its rightful place. He now has much to prove.”
He paused and spoke so only Marr could hear. “And little room
for error.”
Satan spun back around. “The Son of Man will not begin His
campaign before He reaches an appointed age. Twelve years is the
soonest He can be revealed. Thirty is the traditional age for a prophet
to be revealed. Forty is the King’s typical period of testing. We already
have a good power base developed here in the kingdoms of men, and
our armies are strong; but it is going to take a concentrated effort to
prepare for His campaign in this short amount of time. You generals
shall continue to focus on leaders, governments, and systems; but the
rest of your forces must concentrate on individuals. The Son of Man
will need to muster an army from the faithful in Israel. Therefore,
your job is to promote those who belong to us and decimate and
oppress those who do not.”
Satan turned and sat down on his throne with his hand still
perched atop the scepter in its vertical position of power. He gazed
over his subjects with a burning stare. He snorted a blast of fire
from his flared nostrils. “If anyone learns of the Son of Man’s actual
location,” he said, shooting a sarcastic sneer toward Marr, “I must be

notified immediately. I will tolerate no more blunders like the one
that took place in Bethlehem.”
After asserting one more glare of superiority over his inferiors, he
lifted his staff straight up and brought the clawed tip crashing down
onto the smoke–covered floor. An explosion of fire and smoke rocked
the throne room and blasted through every exterior opening. All the
lesser spirits eavesdropping on the proceedings while stacked up on
the outside of the arched portals received a blast of fire in their faces
that sent them flailing in all directions like gnats caught in a summer
storm. Inside the room the flash lasted only a moment, followed by a
rush of blazing wind, followed by a deathly silence. The generals lay
strewn about like discarded rubbish, and Satan and his throne and
the billows of black smoke had vanished. A wistful layer of smoke
swirled across the stone tile.
Marr jumped up off the floor and barked to the rest of the

A sudden gust of desert wind blasted through Herod’s arched
windows and billowed the bottoms of the heavy curtains. A weighty,
ornate lampstand crashed onto the tile floor with a metallic clatter.
Herod and everyone in the room gasped from the unexpected startle.
After an awkward moment of silence, Herod motioned with his hand
and an attendant picked up the lampstand. Herod continued with
his daily business.

lric crested a small hill on the trail and spotted the caravan
traveling ahead of them. Joseph led with his hand cart. Mary
walked behind Joseph’s cart, the donkey’s rope slack in her

hand. Elric walked beside the cart where the Child slept.

“Hey, look at that,” Joseph called back to Mary.
“Keep up your pace and pass them by,” Elric spoke into the air.
“Pass them quickly.”
Elric’s words spun up like a tiny tornado and whirled into Joseph
and Mary’s spirits.

“It’s a caravan,” Joseph said. “I wonder if they are bound for
Egypt. If they are, perhaps we could join their company.”
Mary shook her head and said, “Something inside tells me we
should pass by and continue on our own.”
“Pass them by,” Elric said again.
“We should at least see where they are going,” Joseph said.
Mary shook her head again but pursed her lips tight.
“Pass them quickly.” Elric said. “There are enemies amongst
them.”
Elric’s words swirled through the rising dust, and soon the sounds
of Joseph and Mary’s carts on the uneven gravel became lost in the
larger din of many hooves and scuffling feet and multiple wheeled
equipment and snorts of beasts and livestock.
Joseph approached a pair of men on camels, bringing up the
rear. “Good afternoon,” Joseph shouted over the clamor. “What is
your destination?”
“Egypt, most of us,” answered the nearest merchant who swayed
with the rhythm of his beast.
Joseph turned back toward Mary and echoed, “Egypt.” He lifted
his eyebrows and motioned toward the men as if to say, “Should I ask
them?”
Mary began by shaking her head again, but then shrugged her
shoulders.
“Kind sir,” Joseph said in his raised voice, “would it be possible
for us to join up with your caravan? We are also going to Egypt.”
The second merchant, a kindly man with a sun–baked
complexion and a scruffy, dirty beard answered, “It is not a matter
for us. You need to get permission from him.” He pointed toward

A NEW PLAN

231

the daunting Roman soldier who approached from the front on a
powerful steed with a bright red crest above its head.
“A Roman soldier!” Mary stopped and scurried to the back of
the donkey cart. She climbed onto the cart and held Jesus close. She
fumbled with His blanket and covered Him as much as possible while
mouthing silent prayers.
Elric continued walking with his chin up and eyes fixed on the
soldier. Here we go. I wonder if they know of Herod’s edict.
The soldier pulled his horse up short of Joseph and announced
in a commanding voice as his steed pranced in place, “Who are you,
and what is your business?”
A low–ranking demon alighted beside the horse and expanded
to the full extent of his power. He had the typical hollow pits of evil
for eyes, and his teeth formed rows of stained conical spikes. He had
a notably flat nose, but his bony eyebrows and chin protruded with
grotesque prominence.
“A captain of the host,” the demon said, squaring up against
Elric with a drawn sword. “Are you here to do battle? I have over a
dozen swords under my command, so you will be no match for us.”
Elric drew his sword and tightened his jaw. He lies, of course, about
the strength of his numbers. I would run these two beaelzurim off, but
I am constrained by my current mission. And it appears this demon has
spent all his time traveling with these soldiers—which means he probably
does not have up–to–date information of all the recent happenings in
Jerusalem and Bethlehem.
Joseph swallowed hard and bowed before the soldier. “I am
Joseph of Nazareth,” Joseph said. He cleared his throat and motioned
toward Mary with a trembling hand. “And this is my wife, Mary. We

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

232

are traveling to . . . to the south. I was talking with these kind men
who tell me you are on your way to Egypt. I was asking them if we
could join your caravan for as long as our paths overlap.”
Elric answered the demon with a cool, even tone. “I am merely
escorting my charges to their destination.”
“I see,” the demon said. He examined the three travelers over
Elric’s shoulder.
Elric tightened his grip on his sword.
The soldier eyed the young couple and the bundle in Mary’s
arms. Jesus tried to peek out from behind the blanket, but Mary
pulled the blanket back over His head.
“And what manner of charge would require the services of a
captain, I wonder?” the demon said.
“We all have our assignments,” Elric answered without changing
his tone.
“Yes. We do. See to it that you do not disturb mine,” the demon
grunted. “You have no authority here. Keep your distance. We shall
all be watching you.”
“Very well,” announced the Roman soldier. With a prancing
jump of his horse, the soldier trotted back up to the front of the
column.
Joseph turned to Mary. “See, everything is going to be fine. We
will be much better off traveling with a group.”
Mary answered with a strained smile.
Elric’s eyes fixed on the two beaelzurim. They conferred together
and shot uneasy glances toward him as the shadows of the caravan
drew long in the late afternoon sun.
***

A NEW PLAN

233

That night, Elric stood beside Joseph at the edge of the campfire.
The warm orange glow lit the faces of the merchants around the
campfire perimeter.
“Do the soldiers always keep their distance like that?” Joseph
asked.
Elric turned his eyes toward the Roman soldier’s campfire, set
off by itself. The soldiers’ bronze and iron glimmered in the firelight.
No beaelzurim amongst them. Where are they? Elric scanned the other
three campfires in the midst of the camp. Not there, either. Where
are . . . an extra set of eyes appeared on the other side of his own
campfire circle. The enemy’s form stayed hidden in the shadows, but
his glowing red eyes made his unwelcome presence known. Elric’s
hand found its hilt and gripped hard.
“Of course,” answered one of the merchants. “They like us less
than we like them.”
All the men in the circle laughed. The laughter echoed through
the stillness of the clear night air.
“But I do prefer traveling with them,” another merchant said.
“Sometimes these trails can be treacherous, especially when you are
carrying money. I always try to travel with one of these armed tax–
transport caravans. Much safer.”
“The soldiers will actually protect you?” Joseph asked.
“Well, more specifically, our coinage.”
“For a price!” one of the others said.
“Yes, for a price, of course. But I think—and I’m sure the rest of
my friends here would agree—that it is worth it.”
The rest nodded. The fire crackled and danced.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“It’s all very legitimate,” he said. “They take a careful inventory
of your cash box, record it, and then take possession of it for the
duration of the trip. At the end, they re-count the money, take their
percentage and you are on your way.”
“And we always pack extra provisions for them for the trip,”
someone said.
“They especially like it when we pack plenty of wine.”
Light–hearted laughter echoed again.
The two beady red eyes hovered near the ear of one of the
merchants. It looked like the shadow spoke to the man. Elric turned
his ear toward the shadow but couldn’t make out the words.
“So,” blurted out the man to Joseph, “are you traveling with any
money?”
“Don’t answer him,” Elric prompted. “He does not need to
know.”
Joseph paused and shuffled his feet in the dirt.
In that same instant, Elric caught some motion out of the corner
of his eye back where Mary and Jesus lay by their carts. The second
demon warrior. The demon didn’t go near Jesus and didn’t seem at
all interested in Him. Instead, the demon poked his head into all
their belongings. In particular, he investigated the chest filled with
gold from the magi. In a single powerful wingbeat Elric pounced
on the enemy with his sword flashing. The blade sizzled and cracked
as it slashed through the night air. It caught the intruder mid-torso
and sent him spiraling off into the darkness amid a cloud of yellow
smoke. Moments later, the intruder reappeared on the other side of
the campfire, and now four sinister red orbs peered back across the
flames.

A NEW PLAN

235

The demons spoke aloud. “You should put your treasure into the
soldier’s box.” Their voices sounded smooth, and the words bounced
across the air like tiny tongues of fire until they shot into the spirits of
everyone there, including Joseph.
One of the merchants broke the uncomfortable silence with an
understanding, helpful tone. “You need not answer about the money
you have. It’s none of our business. However, by your hesitation, I
sense that perhaps you are carrying more than you care to reveal.”
“If I were you,” another merchant said, “I would definitely think
about taking whatever you have and checking it in with the soldiers.”
“Oh, I agree,” several others said.
Joseph nodded and rubbed his chin.
Elric countered, “You do not need their protection. The Lord is
your shield. Trust Him.”
The enemy voices didn’t let up. “Listen to reason. Rely on the
soldiers. It is the safest option. Trust us. Trust these men.”
Elric gritted his teeth and shot across the top of the campfire
flames with his sword bearing down on the two enemy warriors. They
split and flittered off in opposite directions. Elric couldn’t chase them
down without leaving Jesus, so he returned to his post near Joseph
and continued countering the suggestions of the enemy.
What is their objective? He watched the two beaelzurim
conferencing at the other end of the camp. Why would they care about
this gold? What would—where are they going? Both of the demons flew
off to the west and disappeared over a distant hill. Oh. Now it all
becomes clear. I need to act fast. He flashed a signal to one of Timrok’s
hidden warriors. In an instant, Chase appeared at Elric’s side with

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

236

his sword drawn. He turned with his sword each direction, ready for
battle, but lowered it with a puzzled expression.
Elric said, “Go immediately to Egypt and fetch Zaben. We have
a change in plans.”
***
Elric and Zaben crouched low in the dirt behind Joseph’s cart.
They spoke in hushed tones.
“Things have not progressed as planned,” Elric said. “Joseph has
joined up with this caravan, and with their pace, our entire timetable
will be off. To make matters worse, I believe the enemy is planning
an ambush.”
Zaben didn’t look worried or surprised. “An ambush? For the
money?”
Elric nodded.
“Have we received authority to protect these other travelers?”
“No. Our charge is the King.”
Zaben bit his lip and smiled. “I have an idea how we can use this
turn of events to our benefit.”
The two went to work. For lack of time, they laid out a new plan
in rough. It would be up to Zaben to work through all the details,
prepare things in Egypt, and pass along the plan to Timrok’s team.
Elric returned to his post, seemingly unmoved, just before the
two beaelzurim reappeared from their mysterious errand. They eyed
him and ducked into the night shadows. Elric returned an icy stare
and crossed his arms.

he following morning, Joseph opened his trunk for the Roman
detail commander.

The commander gasped. “By the gods!”
“It won’t be a problem, will it?” Joseph asked.
“No, no. But how is it a young couple of your apparent means
should have a treasure of this size?”
Joseph closed the chest lid. “It was a gift.”
“Yes, of course.” The soldier stepped back and raised his chin.
“At your request, I will put this in the official stores and assume
responsibility for its safe passage. You agree to the fees for this service?”
237

238

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Yes.”
“Brutus, bring the ledger. Joseph, you stand here and witness the
counting.”
The two beaelzurim cackled and rubbed their hands together
with glee during the counting. Elric stood back and pretended not
to notice.
The remainder of the day plodded by with dry and dusty
monotony. They traveled with few breaks and stopped at early dusk
to set up camp for the night. The evening campfires hosted pleasant
and lighthearted conversations, and the soldiers kept to themselves
a stone’s throw away from the others. By the time the last of the
campfire embers flickered out, the night settled into a cool stillness,
and everyone slept hard from the long day’s effort—everyone except
three rival spirits.
Elric kept a careful distance from the two beaelzurim. He
watched their activities but never moved from his station beside
Joseph and Mary.
The two demons worked on the soldiers. They ambled from
one soldier to the next speaking words of sleep and exhaustion into
the air. Their words settled like clouds over the soldiers and hung in
the Middle Realm air like a thick fog. They came to the two night
watchmen who sat at their posts on opposite ends of the cache wagon.
The demons stood face to face with the watchmen and breathed
puffs of reddish–orange smoke into their faces.
“Sleep,” the spirits said. “Sleep.”
The words formed into layers of fog that settled over the
watchmen. The men shifted in their seats and rubbed their eyes. They
blinked with heavy eyelids. Their heads nodded. They stretched. They

AMBUSHED

239

blinked some more. Their limbs went limp, and their chins sank into
their chests.
The two dark shadows wisped throughout the remainder of the
camp, burying everyone else in a fog of slumber. Even the beasts and
livestock became groggy and lethargic. The shadows shot cautious
glances Elric’s way, and his muscles grew more tense with each grave
moment. One of the demons approached too close to Elric’s position,
and Elric flashed his sword, pulling it part way out of its scabbard.
The demon withdrew and slinked among the soldiers. The other
demon flew off over the hill to the west.
Elric pushed his sword back into its place and waited. It won’t
be long now.
***
Silent and motionless, Elric stood over Joseph, Mary, and
the Baby. Their heavy breathing, with the snores of the rest of the
travelers, mixed with the crickets’ song like a peaceful lullaby over the
camp. But there was no peace in the Middle Realm. A noxious mist
of stupor hung over every living thing. Lethargy. Darkness. Death.
Elric brushed away a floating tuft of mist with his hand.
Any moment now. They must be close. They should be . . . yes.
There it is. The unmistakable, erratic beating of beaelzurim wings
echoing over the hill. And next . . . The muffled hooves of a dozen
horses stepping softly through the western darkness. If the Roman
watchmen were awake, they would surely hear the incoming band of
bandits. But they are buried so deep that it would take a trumpet blast
to rouse them.

240

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

The one demon who had left earlier returned, leading a band
of men and another four demons with them. Six enemy spirits now.
Elric drew his sword for all to see and stood still. He glanced around
the outer perimeter without moving his head. He motioned with his
hand for Timrok’s concealed team to stay down. This is not going to be
easy for Timrok and his team to watch.
The bandits stopped well outside the camp and grouped together.
The demons flapped like bats over the heads of the troop of horsemen
and shouted inciting war chants. Their words formed tornados of
fire that swirled through the air in the Middle Realm. The waves
of energy pulsed outward until the horsemen became engulfed and
controlled by it. The men’s eyes blazed with fervor.
Elric jutted his jaw outward with clenched teeth and breathed
hard through his flared nostrils.
The physical world lay under a blanket of stillness. Quiet,
peaceful, still.
The mounting pressure of evil reached an exploding point,
and the horsemen surged into the sleeping camp. They targeted the
unsuspecting Roman soldiers, and the sleeping watchmen on the
perimeters fell first. Before they could open their eyes, the watchmen
were overrun.
The raiders liberated the watchmen’s spirits from their mortal
bodies, and the beaelzurim slung their pulsing black cords of energy
like a whip, wrapping around the dazed and confused spirits. It all
happened in a blink, and the demons went on to help lead the battle.
They didn’t indwell the horsemen, but they did use the human hands
to wield the physical steel. They burst from one human attacker to the
other, seizing the hilt like a glove over the human hand and guiding
its course.

AMBUSHED

241

The remainder of the Roman soldiers woke from the sounds of
the attack, but two of the demons flapped their wings, raising a dense
cloud of spiritual dust. The trained, disciplined fighters floundered
about, stumbling over their sandals, clamoring for their weapons,
and bumping into each other. They failed to put together a cohesive
defense and became easy prey for the fast–moving attackers. Severed
arms and heads littered the blood–soaked dirt only moments into the
fight, and soul after soul entered eternity met by the bindings and
jeers of spiritual beings the dying men didn’t even believe existed.
Half a dozen soldiers made it to their feet and took a stand.
They swung their swords at the fast–moving horsemen. One of the
horsemen fell. A soldier ran him through in a vicious thrust. In a rage,
the soldier continued slashing and stabbing the dead body and failed
to see another attacker coming from behind. With a single strike of a
horseman, the soldier fell in a heap beside the man he had just killed.
In that instant, the two slain men stood face to face, their spirits each
bound by unbreakable chains.
Elric shook his head and brushed a tear from his eye. Just a
moment ago, they were mortal enemies, filled with hatred toward each
other. Only now do they realize they were mutual victims of a different
enemy, an enemy they didn’t know existed and had no power to fight.
Now their eyes are open, but it’s too late.
The Physical Realm, quiet and peaceful only moments
before, rocked with the pounding of horses’ hooves, clanging
metal, and men’s cries. And here I stand, constrained to let this evil
run its course. In the center of the battle, a soldier’s sword met
the sword of an attacker with a crash. The steel—it doesn’t ring out
as crisply as it does in the Middle Realm, and the collisions don’t throw
as many sparks. And

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

242

the pace of combat is much slower. The soldier screamed and fell to the
ground. But the cries of pain from the men are more desperate. More
permanent.
In the midst of the mayhem, the attackers hitched two spare
horses to the wagon that held all the guarded treasure. The wagon
leapt forward through the battle and charged toward the western
shadows.
The other men in the camp awoke and rushed toward the fight
with swords and long knives in hand. Too late. The cache wagon
reached the edge of the camp, and the horsemen withdrew and raced
after it. The pack of marauders disappeared behind a noisy cloud of
dust.
***
The camp became quiet again, but now the silence dripped with
death and despair. The only sounds in the Physical Realm were the
groans of the wounded. In the Middle Realm, all six of the beaelzurim
rummaged through the carnage, laughing and taunting the fallen,
whose spirits now stood bound, awaiting their eternal fate.
Only four soldiers remained functional, including the team
commander, and they had each received minor wounds. With slow
and solemn movements, they checked the conditions of each of their
fallen comrades. Most had already gone, but some had suffered mortal
wounds and still grasped for life as they awaited imminent death.
With reluctance, the ones left standing took their own weapons and
used them to end their fallen comrades’ suffering. With each mercy
killing, at least one of the demons helped drive the final thrust.

AMBUSHED

243

With each death, Elric flinched and gritted his teeth. Your day is
coming. You will answer for all this death. The day of the King’s vengeance
is nearer than you know.
He looked back at his charges. Mary held Jesus as He slept.
Joseph crouched low beside them. Joseph had no weapon and shook
with fear. Elric spoke peace and comfort. Kneeling beside them He
rested his hands on their backs.
Something stirred in the Middle Realm all over the battle site.
Mighty demons—one for each of the fallen men—appeared and
ushered the spirits of the fallen men away. The enemy paraded their
spoils before Elric and reveled in their triumphs. He gritted his teeth
and remained still and stone-faced. A few somber moments passed,
and they had all departed—the souls of the fallen along with their
escorts. The other four demons flew several swooping victory laps
over the battlefield and left.
Now the silence carried a hollow emptiness.
Across the camp, the remaining two demons surrounded the
Roman detail commander. Elric shook his head—he had seen this
situation thousands of times before. The commander sat, defeated,
with his head between his knees, and the two demons stood on either
side of him, speaking to him. If they are successful, there might be
another one lost tonight.
“What am I going to do?” one demon said. “I am a complete
failure. I have lost all these men—and the cache wagon. It’s all my
fault. It’s all my fault.”
The demon’s words pummeled the commander’s spirit with a
nonstop stream of poison.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

244

The o ther demon spoke. “ What will h appen w hen w e get t o
Egypt? My career is over—my life is over! I will probably be executed
for this failure. Look at all this blood. It’s my fault. What good is a
soldier who cannot even protect a fortified position? I am a . . . ”
The crowd of men from the camp pressed in around the
commander. They pelted him with questions in rapid fire from
all directions, and he couldn’t begin to answer them all.
“What happened?”
“Why did your men not put up a fight?”
“Did you not have night watchmen on duty?”
“Why don’t you pursue them?”
The soldier lifted his head and blurted out, “There are too many,
and I don’t have enough men left.”
The grilling continued. “Who were they?”
“Where did they come from?
“Should we send someone to track them so we can mount a
counterattack later?”
“What do we do now? Our entire livelihood was on that wagon.”
This question brought all the others to a halt. The group became
quiet.
The commander struggled to his feet. “I don’t know what to do,”
he said in a low, defeated voice. “I have never had a loss like this. I
suppose the only course of action is to finish our trip and see what
the officials in Egyptus have to say.”
One of the merchants asked, “Will Rome cover our losses since
they were officially under your charge?”
“They should, by statute. But it will depend on the proconsul.”

245

“Typical Roman bureaucracy,” muttered several of the men. The
men shook their heads, threw up their arms, and turned back toward
their tents.
“Wait,” called the commander. “I’m very sorry we lost all the
money. But look around. I also lost these good men. Could some of
you help with the fallen? I need to get them wrapped up and placed
on wagons. I can’t leave them out here on the trail.”
“Look at the way they are all staring at me,” said one of the
demons to the soldier. “They hate me. They all hate me. They all
think it’s my fault. I’m all alone. There is no one who cares about
what I’m going through. I am completely alone. They are all against
me. The whole world is against me. I’m alone.”
A handful of men turned back. “We will help. We can’t leave the
dead lying here in the open. They deserve to be brought home.”

T

he next morning, Elric stood in the middle of the camp with the
rising sun to his back. The lines of merchants with their carts and
animals plodded by on each side. It felt somehow wrong to just

walk away from this place. The blood of so many innocent men called
out from the ground. The spiritual energy of their cries for justice rose
and coalesced in the air of the Middle Realm. They swirled together
and became large spiritual stones and fell back to the ground. As the
physical world passed by, Elric gathered the stones and built a pile—a
small monument to the lives stolen by the enemy. He knelt in front of
the pile with his hand on top of the final stone.
246

DARK THOUGHTS

247

“One day,” he said. “The King will establish justice on the earth.”
He looked toward Jesus in the back of Joseph’s cart. “One day, very
soon. The enemy will be put beneath His feet.”
He stood and turned south. The caravan had already traveled
well down the trail. With five strokes of his wings he caught up and
alighted next to Joseph’s cart. His wings folded into his back, and
he walked alongside. The men in the caravan were solemn. There
were no conversations, no laughter. Only the sounds of the carts and
hooves.
From this position, Elric checked the lead Roman soldier in
front. The soldier swayed to the cadence of his mighty warhorse with
his back as straight as he could marshal. The two demons walked
alongside and fed his dark thoughts with even darker thoughts. Elric
strained to hear their words over the caravan noise.
“I can feel the stares of all the men in the caravan,” one demon
said. “I know they are looking at me. They hate me. They think I’m
worthless. My last three soldiers don’t think any better of me, either.
I am all alone. All alone. A failure.”
Elric clenched his fists.
The demons cackled to each other and continued their attack.
“It is hopeless,” called out one.
“Completely hopeless,” echoed the other.
Elric tightened his jaw and breathed through his nose.
“It’s hopeless,” the soldier muttered.
“Aargh! Enough!” Elric shouted. He leapt with a roar and led
with his blade toward the enemy. Just before he made impact, the two
darted out of reach.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

248

Elric turned to the soldier and spoke in a loud voice. “It’s
not hopeless! You still have much to live for. Turn to the King for
strength—He can give you life and a future.”
Elric’s words formed into small darts of light and shot toward
the soldier’s spirit. The man’s black spiritual armor blocked most of
the words. Elric spoke them again.
Words from the King rained from the throne room, trying to
penetrate the soldier’s shell.
“The King is already speaking to you. Of course He is. I just
need to keep the poison of the enemy out of your spirit so you can
hear the King.” Elric touched the soldier’s leg. “Listen to me. You are
not alone. The King loves you. He is with you now and He . . . ”
Elric glanced back. The two demons approached Joseph and
Mary from behind. They are baiting me to draw me away from the
soldier. But I have no choice. With a flash of his wings, he returned to
his position beside Joseph—and the demons scurried off. Moments
later they came back to work on the soldier, dragging him deeper
into the depths of despair. Their words formed giant meat hooks that
clawed at his shoulders and pulled him down.
Elric ground his teeth. Grrr! I can’t let them . . . He charged
toward the soldier. The demons scattered. Elric spoke a few words
of light into the air to strengthen the soldier. One demon circled
around behind Joseph and Mary. Elric raced back to his post. This
time, though, one of the demons stayed behind Elric’s position while
the other worked on the soldier.
I am constrained again. All he could do was watch from a distance
as the soldier’s thoughts turned darker and darker.

DARK THOUGHTS

249

For the lead Roman soldier, the dreary day turned into a
despondent night. The rest of the travelers huddled around their
campfires scattered about the nighttime campsite, but he withdrew
from everyone and stared into the flames of his own campfire.
The hushed voices from all around the camp sounded distant and
detached. He could only hear the crackling of his fire—and the
thoughts that wouldn’t go away. He didn’t hear voices in his head,
but something within him formed thoughts that stampeded through
his consciousness.
I will never recover from this. There is no hope. I am all alone.
One of the men’s voices from across the camp caught his
attention—just the voice, no discernable words.
Just listen to everyone out there talking. I know they are all talking
about me. Blaming me. Cursing me. They hate me, I know it. I don’t
care. I hate them, too. This whole thing is their fault. If I didn’t have to
travel so slowly so they could all keep up, I could have been to Egyptus by
now.
He glanced over at his three men. Two poked at their fire with
sticks while the third redressed a bandage on his arm.
Worthless, undisciplined cowards. I hate them, too. They are as
much to blame for this as those miserable merchants. Why can’t I get a
squad of skillful soldiers? I always get the rejects. I hate them. They have
all ruined my life.
An ember snapped and pulled his gaze back to the flickering
glow of his own fire.
My life is ruined. This is it—there is nothing left. There is nothing
left in life worth living for.
He pulled his dagger from its sheath and fingered its tip and
razor edges. Its lethal steel glowed in the light of the campfire.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

250

It would be much easier if I didn’t have to face tomorrow.
The reality of where his thoughts were taking him registered with
his body, and his hands instinctively dropped the dagger into the dirt.
Everything within his physical being strived for self-preservation, and
these thoughts sent a convulsive shudder through his bones.
He sat motionless for a long time and watched the flames of his
campfire retreat into the orange core of the embers. All the while, he
couldn’t shake the hopelessness of it all. He picked up the dagger and
brushed off the dirt.
***
Elric took a deep breath and shook his head. This is a critical
moment. I don’t think he can stand the attack much longer. One of the
beaelzurim continued his barrage upon the soldier, dancing around
him, clawing at him, speaking to him, breathing sulfurous smoke
into his eyes. Elric clenched his sword handle and pulled the sword
part way out of its sheath. He looked back into the nearby shadows.
The two glowing red eyes of the second demon peered back at him.
He pushed his sword back into place and gritted his teeth.
The frenzied chanting of the attacking demon rose higher and
higher. Elric squeezed his eyes shut tight.
“Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!” the demon shouted.
Elric heard a gasp. He opened his eyes. The soldier slumped
over. Both the demons erupted in triumphant laughter. One of them
bound the spirit of the confused dead soldier, and the other jeered
and mocked him to his face. A few moments later another mighty
demon appeared and took the man’s spirit away.

The quiet camp slept, unaware of the battle that had just been
fought. Elric wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his tunic. He sat down
on Joseph’s cart and gazed up into the stars.
***
Days later, Elric looked up at the high outer walls of the Egyptian
palace from his seat on the back of Joseph’s cart. The air in the Middle
Realm felt calm, quiet.
He shook his head and crossed his arms. Only weeks ago, this place
was the center of the most concentrated demonic siege since the Rebellion.
And Zaben and his team, along with four legions of elzurim, held the
enemy off for over a year and then held them in place long enough for the
King to escape from Bethlehem.
Now it appeared to be devoid of beaelzurim presence. Abandoned.
The caravan of battle–shocked and road–weary travelers rumbled
past the thick walls of the northern entrance. Elric spotted Zaben
atop the battlement wall and let a small sad smile slip from his lips
when their eyes met.
Zaben gave a single nod of his head.

T

he lazy summer afternoon heat rested like a blanket over the flock
of sheep in the fields outside Nazareth, and Levi and Daniel did
their best to stay cool under the shade of some palm trees. Daniel

was ten years old—awkward and curious, and Levi was seventeen—wise
and energetic.

“I’m confused,” Daniel said.
“About what?” Levi said.
“Oh, you know, God, spiritual things.”
“What’s the problem?”
252

DARK BEGINNINGS

253

Daniel tossed a small stone and shrugged. “I guess it’s because of
Father. Ever since he started following the teachings of the Sadducees,
he believes there are no such things as spiritual beings. But I saw
something that night. If there aren’t any angels, they must have been
something else. But I know I saw something. It makes me wonder
if . . . ”
“Anything he’s ever taught us is true?”
“See? You understand. You’re the only one I can talk to.”
“You’re my little brother.”
“I’m Jesse’s little brother, too. And I can’t talk to him at all. He
treats me like Father. He is always correcting me and making me feel
stupid.”
“They don’t mean any harm.”
“But what if God doesn’t even exist? What if all the stories about
our heritage are made up?”
“I will agree that some of the teachings of the Sadducees don’t
seem right, but I still think God is the Lord and we are His chosen
people. And I believe the Messiah will come and save us—maybe very
soon.”
“I don’t know.”
“Besides, how else would you explain the angels you saw?”
Daniel remained quiet for a minute. “Maybe they’re ghosts.
Spirits of dead people. Maybe they’re all around us all the time, and
we can’t see them.”
“Ghosts?” Levi scrunched up his face.
“Yes, think about it. If there truly are angels, and if God is truly
up there looking out for His chosen people, wouldn’t He have done

something about all those babies Herod killed? Wouldn’t the angels
have stopped it?”
“Well—”
“But if they’re just spirits, they can’t actually stop bad things
from happening.”
“I suppose I don’t know enough about all this kind of thing.”
Daniel scratched patterns in the dirt with a stick. “Do you think
we can talk to them?” he asked. “Do you think the spirits can hear
us?”
“I don’t know,” Levi said. “I do think God hears us, and He is a
spirit.”
“I wonder if they can talk to us.” Daniel tilted his good ear
upward.
“Well, you heard something once, didn’t you?”
“Yes, but that was just one time, and there were a lot of them.
And I don’t think they were talking directly to me. Have you ever
heard anything?”
“No. I must not be as perceptive as you are.”
Daniel smiled.
Levi leaned back on his elbows. “You know, God talked to Moses
and Samuel and all the prophets, so I do think it is possible for people
to hear His voice sometimes.”
“I wonder why we don’t see and hear from spirits all the time?”
“I don’t know for sure.” Levi paused. “Maybe it’s because
God wants us to live our lives by simple faith in Him. If we were
constantly listening to spirits, we would not be relying on Him. Not
only that . . . ”
Levi stopped talking and sprang to his feet.

255

“What?” Daniel asked. “What is it?”
“I don’t like the looks of this,” Levi said, pointing down the
gently sloping hill. A wide foot path ran along the base of it, and two
Roman soldiers in full gear had left the path and marched toward
them.
“This cannot be good. Daniel, I need you to step back and stay
behind me. Go on! Do as I say.” He pushed Daniel back with his arm.
“Oh, Lord, help us,” Levi whispered under his breath.
The two soldiers clanged to a stop in front of him.
***
Four humans faced off in the hot afternoon sun on a hillside
outside Nazareth—two muscled, well–armed soldiers and two young
shepherds with wooden staffs and dusty sandals. Another presence
who cast no shadow stood beside the soldiers—a beaelzur lieutenant
named Vorsogh. His craggy face looked almost reptilian. Instead
of a nose, he had an inset cleft bordered by two spiny ridges. His
cheekbones were high and sharp. His eye sockets were deep, bony,
and black; and his eyes were burning red. His arm was as big around
as a man’s chest, and in his twisted hand he held a rugged blade, grayblack and well-used.
The instant Levi’s prayer left his lips, a warrior in white alighted
next to Levi. The angel’s wings disappeared into his back, and his
sword swung into a defensive position.
Vorsogh smiled with an unsurprised sneer.
Levi spoke first. “If you are here for directions, just keep following
that path. Nazareth is up the road about three miles.”

256

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

The angel stepped in front of Levi and squared up with Vorsogh.
“Take your men and leave this place.”
Vorsogh huffed a dismissive snort. “Step aside, puny puppet of
the King. I will take what I want here, and there is nothing you can
do to stop me.”
One of the Roman soldiers answered Levi, laughing, “We are
not here for directions. We are in charge of bringing back supper for
the whole company. We require two of the sheep from your flock.”
“In that case, let me take you to our father,” Levi said. “I’m sure
he will be happy to sell you the sheep for a fair price.”
The other soldier stepped forward. “I think you do not
understand. We intend to take what we want, and you are going to
step aside.”
Vorsogh huffed again, hearing his words being echoed by the
soldier.
“You can’t do that,” Levi said. “You have no right to come and
take whatever you want. There are laws.”
The soldier grabbed Levi’s outer garment in his fist and shoved
it up into Levi’s chin.
“I am the law, and you had best do as I say.”
He gave Levi a backward shove, and the angel took a swing at
Vorsogh, shouting, “Enough! Call your men off!”
The two spirits became locked in a fierce battle. In the Middle
Realm, flames, flashes, and sparks filled the air accompanied by loud
crashes, clangs, and shouts. The two combatants spun, dodged, and
flew in high–speed arcs.
Daniel hid behind a palm tree, but when the soldier manhandled
Levi, Daniel rushed out shouting, “Leave my brother alone!”

DARK BEGINNINGS

257

“No!” shouted the angel to Daniel between a thrust and a parry.
“Get back!”
Daniel pounded with both fists on the chest of one soldier, but
his adolescent hands bouncing off the bronze chest plate only made
the two soldiers laugh. The one soldier put his hand on Daniel’s head
and held him back beyond the short reach of the boy’s arms. Then
he placed his foot against Daniel’s hip and gave a solid kick, sending
Daniel flopping backward out of control.
“Leave him alone,” Levi shouted. He jumped back to his feet,
grabbed his staff, and raised it toward the soldier.
“Don’t do it!” the angel yelled to Levi. “Get back! You cannot
win.”
The other soldier pulled his sword.
“Kill him!” screeched Vorsogh to the soldier. “Kill him!” Time
seemed to screech to a stop. Each frame of action clicked
forward in a slow blur.
Levi advanced toward the soldier.
Daniel jumped back to his feet.
Vorsogh clipped the angel’s knee with his blade, sending the
angel falling backward.
The soldier swung his sword in a horizontal arc toward Levi.
Vorsogh pounced toward the soldier and wrapped his hands
around the soldier’s swinging hilt.
Daniel leapt in front of Levi, reaching for the arms of the soldier
with the advancing sword.
The angel leapt toward Daniel and pushed him downward from
above.
Daniel fell face first toward the ground.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

258

The soldier’s steel whistled a hair’s length over Daniel’s head.
The soldier’s steel caught Levi mid-torso and nearly cut him in
half.
Levi screamed in pain.
Vorsogh screamed in victory.
The angel screamed in defeat.
Daniel screamed in horror.
The whole event played out in an instant, and time resumed its
regular course.
Levi struggled frantically to find his breath, but his life pooled
beneath him and flooded down the hill, and he slipped away quickly.
Daniel knelt beside Levi and fumbled to push organs back into his
ruined body. The soldiers scrambled into the flock and retrieved the
spoils of their conquest. Covered in shiny red blood up to his elbows
and all over the front of his tunic, Daniel kept screaming for help and
screaming in anger and screaming in helpless anguish.
Vorsogh flew off with a triumphant shout as soon as he felt the
soldier’s blade do its work. Another human life cut short, dozens of
other human lives scarred beyond repair—this had been a wonderful
victory for him indeed. He circled back and found a hiding spot to
watch the aftermath.
The angel warrior in white knelt beside Daniel and tried to
comfort him and calm his shattered mind, but he could not break
through the hysterics of the moment. Then, another angel showed up
and greeted Levi’s liberated spirit.
“Come,” the angel said to Levi. “I am here to take you to your
rest.”

DARK BEGINNINGS

259

“What about Daniel?” Levi asked. “I am the one who takes care
of him.”
“The Lord is the one who takes care of him,” the angel said.
“You have been the Lord’s instrument until now. Now your work is
finished.”
“Will he be all right?”
The angel paused for a moment. He put his hand on Levi’s
shoulder. “Daniel will face some difficult choices in the near future.
If he makes the wrong choices, I am afraid the enemy will have free
rein over him.”
“But he will be delivered, right?”
“With God, all things are possible. Come, it is time for you to
meet the King. In His presence is fullness of joy, and He has been
longing to speak with you face to face.”
The two spirits disappeared.
Vorsogh watched the words of peace and comfort from the
remaining warrior and the Spirit of the King rain down on Daniel.
None of the light penetrated into Daniel’s spirit. A thick veil of
darkness blocked every word. Vorsogh smiled. This could be a unique
opportunity to move in and take advantage of a weak mind in a
vulnerable state. Silently he watched—and waited.

oseph gawked at the expansive ceilings and the magnificent
court room of the Roman proconsul in Egypt with his mouth
half open. Besides the temple in Jerusalem, he had never seen

such grandeur. He felt small and out of place, and he tried to take in all
the details of the architecture, the artwork, the . . .

“Technically,” one of the merchants next to him whispered,
“some percentage of our losses should be restored; however, the
outcome of matters like this depend on the disposition of the Roman
governor deciding the case.”
Joseph nodded.
260

PROVISION

261

“And from what I hear, this proconsul is a hard man. I will be
surprised if we receive anything.”
The large group of dusty travelers standing at the back of the
court turned their ears toward the front, bit their fingernails, fidgeted
their feet. Joseph stretched to see past the men in front of him. At the
front of court, the three soldier escorts from the caravan, flanked by
the palace centurion, stood at attention and spoke with the governor.
Joseph couldn’t make out the words of their muffled voices. From
the expression on the governor’s face, they must be recounting the horrors
of the nighttime raid. Four merchants stood with the soldiers as
representatives for the others. The governor also spoke with them.
The talking finished. The governor sat back in his tall wooden
chair.
“And now we shall know,” the merchant next to Joseph whispered,
still biting his nails.
The proconsul sat forward on the edge of his seat. He lifted
his voice for everyone in the court. “You men have suffered much.”
His voice echoed off the stone floor and walls. “In the wake of such
villainy, there is no reimbursement I can offer you to reestablish your
faith in the common decency of your fellow man. Seeing death the
way you have steals a part of your soul that can never be replaced.”
The merchant next to Joseph stopped biting his nails and let his
hand drop to his side. He turned to Joseph and let out a long sigh.
The governor continued, “However, since your treasures were
under the guardianship of the Roman Empire, it is my judgment that
your financial losses should be restored in full.”
The merchant’s eyes and mouth opened wide. Joseph grabbed
him by the arms and they both laughed. For just an instant, the

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

262

other merchants did the same. Then, the proper decorum of the court
gripped the entire group. They turned toward the governor and bowed.
To the centurion, the governor said, “Take these men to the
treasury and see to it they are reimbursed according to the records.”
“Yes sir.”
“And then, see to the fallen. Their families need to know that
they served and died with honor.”
***
As he’d done in the proconsul’s courtroom, Joseph took in the
grandeur and size of the room of the main treasury. While not as big
and ornate as the proconsul’s court, it still made him feel small. He
took another step forward in the line.
“They brought in the head treasurer to administer the
reimbursements,” the merchant in front of him said.
The man at the table had a pile of parchments strewn in front of
him. He double checked one record, made markings on others. Then
he spoke to an attendant who retreated to the vault and returned
with four large canvas bags. The treasurer counted out coins, refilled
the bags, handed them to the merchant at the front of the line,
and made more entries on a ledger. The operation proceeded in a
professional manner, and the treasurer didn’t appear to begrudge a
single transaction.
“I almost feel guilty,” Joseph said to the merchant behind him.
“It isn’t anyone’s fault that those bandits stole everyone’s money.
It certainly isn’t the fault of that poor man doing all the work and
pulling from his accounts.”

PROVISION

263

“Don’t feel guilty,” the merchant said. “This is why we travel
under Roman guard. We are only being reimbursed for what is
rightfully ours. This is their lawful duty.”
“Yes, I know,” Joseph said. “Here, you go ahead of me.”
“Are you sure?”
“Yes. Please.”
Joseph continued looking around the room. The columns are so
magnificent. The craftsmanship of the stonework is exquisite. Each pillar
must have taken years to—
“Excuse me,” the man behind him said. “Are you going to . . . ”
He motioned forward with his hand.
“Oh, I’m sorry. Please go ahead.”
Soon Joseph found himself at the very end of the line. It doesn’t
feel right. It’s so much. What will the treasurer say when he sees my entry
in the ledger? It was a gift. I didn’t work for any of . . .
“Next.”
Joseph took a deep breath and stepped up to the man at the
table.
Without looking up from the ledger, the man said, “Name
please.”
“Joseph. Joseph of Nazareth.”
“Joseph of . . . ” The man looked up. His eyes brightened, and
he repeated, “Joseph?”
Does he know me? How could someone in Egypt . . . He squinted
and examined the man’s face. “Benjamin? Is that you?”
Benjamin leapt up, wrapped Joseph in a hug, and exchanged
excited back slaps. They stared at each other with beaming smiles.
“What are you doing here?” Joseph asked.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

264

“It’s a long story. What are you doing here?”
“It’s a long story.”
They both laughed and slapped each other’s shoulders.
“Well,” Joseph said, “I see my cousin who set off to make his
fortunes in exotic places has done very well for himself!”
“Oh, this?” Benjamin shrugged and waved his hand toward the
magnificent room. “This is just . . . well, yes, the Lord has truly blessed
me. But more than that, I am married now. And we have a little boy.”
“You do? Me too!”
“That’s great! It’s so good to see you. How long has it been? It has
to be at least ten years. You weren’t old enough to even grow whiskers,
and now look at you.”
They laughed again.
“I must have you over for supper tonight. Do you have a place
to stay while you are here?”
“No.”
“Then you must stay with us. I insist. This is amazing. What a
coincidence to meet you here like this!”
“Yes, what a coincidence.”
They both stood, grinning at each other.
“Good heavens,” Benjamin said, returning to his seat. “There are
still accounts to settle. Let me see how much this ledger says is owed
to Joseph of Nazareth.”
“Oh, my,” Benjamin choked out with a shocked expression.
“Apparently, my cousin has done well for himself, too.”
Heat rushed to Joseph’s flushed cheeks, and he swallowed hard.
“Yes, well, the Lord has blessed us. I will tell you all about it later.”

Elric, Zaben, and Timrok formed a line along the side wall of
Benjamin and Rachael’s palace residence and watched the humans on
the evening of the caravan’s arrival to Egypt.
“This is Jesus’ first chance to play with someone His own age,
isn’t it?” Zaben said.
Elric laughed. “Yes. Isn’t this wonderful?”
Timrok spun and dodged the two toddler boys in raucous play.
“It makes me want to dance!”
The four adults carried on their conversation over the noise, and
Elric only half-listened. The wives were introduced, and Benjamin said
that maybe he remembered a little girl named Mary from Nazareth
and concluded this Mary must be the same one. They reminisced
about childhood days and laughed.
“And how is your mother?” Benjamin asked.
“I’m afraid she passed almost two years ago,” Joseph said.
“Oh, I’m sorry.”
“Thank you. She was very sick, but she died peacefully, and I was
able to be with her until the end.”
“She was a good woman,” Benjamin said. “I always loved her.”
“Yes, I miss her.”
“Look!” Rachael said, “Jesus is trying to play peek-a-boo with
little James, but James doesn’t know what to do.”
“Oh, that is His favorite game,” Mary said. She got down on the
floor and “found” Jesus under His blanket. Jesus squealed and giggled
and ran around the room. Then He flopped onto the floor and hid
under His blanket again. All the adults laughed. So did Elric, Zaben,
and Timrok.
“Come here, James,” Mary said. She put James’s hands down
near the edge of the blanket. She helped him grasp the blanket and

whispered, “Jesus is hiding. We’re going to find Him. Do you want
to help me?”
James grinned and nodded.
“Get ready. One . . . two . . . three!” Mary helped James yank the
blanket off with a dramatic whoosh. “There you are!”
Jesus laughed, jumped up, and ran around the room. James
screamed and chased Him for five laps. Timrok stood in the center of
the laps with his arms up and spun around with each lap.
“James,” Mary said, returning to her seat. “I love that name. If I
have another son, maybe I will—”
“Hold on there,” said Joseph. “We have enough to worry about
already. Let’s not start thinking about . . . ”
All the adults laughed.
Benjamin and Rachael told their story of how they met, how
Benjamin had gotten promoted to his position, how Rachael had lost
her family and home, and how they had ended up in this beautiful
house inside the palace grounds. Joseph and Mary both remarked
how much they liked it.
“Now,” Benjamin said, “let’s hear your story. What circumstances
bring you to Egypt?”
Joseph looked at Mary. Mary gave a little shrug and nodded her
head.
“It’s complicated. And a little hard to believe, even for us,” Joseph
said. “Maybe we should eat supper and put these two to bed so we
can talk without any interruptions.”
“Yes,” Rachael said. “Good idea. You two take the boys outside
and let them run around while Mary and I prepare the meal.”

Elric, Zaben, and Timrok stepped outside with Benjamin,
Joseph, and the two boys. Timrok watched the boys play for a few
moments but kept scanning the street and rooftops.
“I need a better vantage,” Timrok said. “Captain, by your leave.”
Elric nodded once.
Timrok flew to a nearby rooftop and disappeared from view.
Elric and Zaben watched the boys run for some time without
saying anything. They both basked in the pure joy of children at play.
Elric finally broke the silence. “Nice work preparing the heart of
the proconsul.”
Zaben bit his lip. “I had little to do with it. The Lord had already
done the work.”
“Nevertheless, your plan unfolded exactly as you foresaw. You
have a keen eye for strategy.”
They watched the boys a while longer.
“Was it hard?” Zaben asked. “In the desert, having to stand by
while the enemy claimed their victory?”
Elric’s head drooped low. “All those men. My heart aches. The
Lord’s heart aches. And if not for this mission, I know I could have—”
“We do what must be done,” Zaben said. “We cannot control
the enemy. We cannot control the men.”
“The Lord’s day is coming soon,” Elric said. “I long for the day
when the King finally restores all things.”
Rachael opened the front door. “Supper is ready,” she called out.
“Come in and eat.”
Mealtime conversation centered around life within the palace
compound and the strange year they just had. But something seemed

to have changed a couple of weeks ago, and life appeared to be getting
back to normal.
Elric, Zaben, and Timrok smiled at each other.
With the meal done and the two boys nestled into bed, the
adults settled in for the first quiet moments of the evening. Joseph
and Mary began their story with Zacharias and Elizabeth. Benjamin
and Rachael hung on every word with wide eyes. Then Mary shared
her experience with the angel and her pregnancy.
“Do you mean to say,” Benjamin stuttered, “that Jesus is—”
“I told you it’s a little hard to believe,” Joseph said. “There is a
lot more.”
Zaben chuckled. “It’s not every day that a long–lost cousin
mysteriously shows up and has a Son who is the promised Messiah.
These kinds of things don’t happen to ordinary people.”
“They will believe,” Elric said. “Look at how the King is speaking
to them. His words are reaching their spirits.”
Every detail seemed to leave Benjamin and Rachael more and
more stunned. And yet, with every step of the journey, Benjamin and
Rachael gasped less and nodded more.
“And now that you have made it to Egypt, what are you supposed
to do? Where are you supposed to live?” asked Benjamin.
“We don’t know. The angel didn’t tell us that.”
Elric smiled at Zaben and Timrok. He crossed his arms and
stepped forward.
“You have property that is available. You could offer it to Joseph.”
Elric spoke to Benjamin. “Offer him Rachael’s family property.”
Benjamin sat back in his chair and said, “Hmm.” He turned and
whispered in Rachael’s ear. “You know your father’s property? With
the burned-out house? What would you think if we . . . ”

Rachael nodded without hesitation.
“I have an idea,” Benjamin announced. “Remember the house
that we told you about that Rachael left after it burned down? That
property still belongs to her family. The house is mostly a loss, but
there is a good amount of land there and it has a well. We have no
need for the place as long as we are here in the palace. I have been
wanting to restore the house, but I don’t have the time to get out
there and get the work done. Here is what I propose—if the house
was made ready, you and Mary could live there. And we will charge
no rent.”
“Oh, no, we could never—”
“For the rent, I will barter your services as a carpenter. I shall
provide the materials. You provide the building skills. You can rebuild
the house. What do you think?”
Joseph’s eyes filled with tears. “I think . . . ” He paused and
looked to Mary. She nodded and wiped her eyes. “I think that sounds
wonderful!”
“Yes!” Benjamin shouted. He slapped Joseph’s knee. “This is
wonderful! You and I can ride out there first thing tomorrow, and I
will show you the place. Mary and Jesus can stay here with Rachael.
We will survey the house and make plans for rebuilding it. Then, we
will work on getting the materials, and you can get started. Until you
get the place into a livable condition, you will stay here with us.”
“But, if there is much to be done, it could be months before
we—”
“You stay here as long as you need. I’m excited to have family
close, and the boys will have fun together.”
Zaben crossed his arms and smiled. “First, they run for their
lives. Then all their gold is stolen, and they are in a strange country

with no place to stay and no money and no job. Now, in a single day,
their money is restored, they are reunited with distant family, and
they have a place to live.”
Elric nodded and put his hand on Zaben’s shoulder. “A job well
done.”
Timrok grunted. “Well, we didn’t exactly plan on losing the
gold.”
Elric put his other hand on Timrok’s shoulder. He smiled and
gave Timrok a playful shove.

Everything that could burn in Rachael’s old family home had
been destroyed in the fire, but much of the mud brick and mortar
walls remained intact. Joseph began by cleaning out all the charred
remains. After patching parts of the walls in disrepair and applying
a fresh coat of plaster on all the walls to cover the scorch marks, he
set the main timbers for the roof structure. After two months of hard
work, Joseph completed the straw and mud roof, and he felt the time
had come to make the move. Much work remained to complete the
house, but he wanted to let Benjamin and Rachael get their normal
lives back.
At the palace home, Benjamin and Joseph loaded Joseph’s
donkey cart. “Do you know how long you will be here in Egypt?”
Benjamin asked.
“No,” Joseph said. “The angel only said that he would tell us
when it’s time to return.”

“For our sake, I hope it is a long time. Stay in the house as long
as you need. And please come back to the palace often to visit.”
“We will. Thank you again for all your generosity.”
They all exchanged hugs and happy waves. Joseph and Mary left
with Jesus to start a new adventure.
***
The King on Joseph’s donkey cart passed by the ten–mile
perimeter about Rachael’s land, and the senturim at the border averted
their eyes. They followed Elric’s strict instructions not to acknowledge
the King when He crossed their borders, but Elric could sense them
struggling not to bow down. The muscles in their necks twitched,
and they stood rigid as stone. Elric suppressed a grin. After the carts
passed, Elric caught them stealing a glance at the Son of Man, and he
laughed out loud.
“Remember,” he called out to the nearest senturi, “no beaelzurim
cross this border. You have the authority to exercise the sword of
vengeance.”
The senturi replied with a stoic nod.
Joseph and Mary unpacked and hauled things into the house.
Elric stood by the skeleton of the old burned-out stable and stared out
over the horizon. Moments later, Zaben arrived. Then Timrok. Then
Jenli and Lacidar. Each approached like a silent comet, performed a
graceful flare maneuver, touched down, and tucked their wings away.
“Things will be quiet now,” Elric said. “In this remote place with
the senturim in position, we can stay hidden for as long as necessary.”
“How long will the King stay here in Egypt?” Jenli asked.

“I have received no word. Again, we will trust and wait.”
Zaben bit his lower lip and furrowed his brows. “This is a most
peculiar mission. We all know there is a never–ending stream of
direction and revelation coming from the Throne, but we receive
none of it. The silence is unnerving.”
Elric pursed his lips. The lieutenants all gazed off into nothingness.
Zaben said, “We need insight into the enemy’s movements if we
are to prepare for our next phase. Our position here is not favorable
for this.”
“Agreed,” Elric said. “It would be useful to see within Herod’s
camp. The war map will help, but—”
“Send us in,” Timrok said.
“Into the center of the enemy’s stronghold?” Zaben said.
Timrok smiled a sly grin. “Why not?”
Jenli laughed. “It’s easy if you carry a flaming blue sword.”
“Nothing so overt,” Elric said. “But it is a good idea. We need
eyes on the inside.”
Timrok nodded. Zaben raised his eyebrows.
“Our presence must be completely unknown. You can translate
into the Physical Realm in the form of small animals. Others from
your team can do the same or occasionally openly accompany a
human into the stronghold. If the enemy thinks they’re on routine
escort assignment, they should not suspect our objectives.”
Jenli and Zaben gave pensive nods. Timrok gave enthusiastic
nods.
“Lacidar,” Elric said, “you and your team will continue to stay
with the prophet, John.”
Lacidar said, “In His service.”

small gray lizard crept through the open window casement
of Herod’s palace and into the shadows of a corner in the
throne room. From its hiding spot, it watched everything

in the king’s court with knowing eyes.

Herod sat on his throne, conducting important matters of state.
“Look at him,” Molech said to his beaelzurim officers from his
own spiritual throne. “Herod thinks he is in control of his entire
world. He has no idea he is nothing more than a puppet in my hands.
Now, our master is done with him. I almost regret having to destroy
274

him. This man’s ruthless heart and seared conscience has served us
well for many years.”
“What is your plan for the man?” one of the demon officers
asked.
Molech snorted a puff of yellow smoke from his nostrils and
tapped his talons on his armrest. “I will destroy him from the inside
out. I will squeeze every drop of pain from him I can. I will start
slowly, perhaps a stomach ailment. Then, I will continuously increase
his maladies and prolong his agony for as long as the man’s mortal
flesh can endure.”
Molech’s officers laughed, licked their lips, and rubbed their
hands together.
Molech coughed an unintelligible word into his right hand, and
a small plasma ball formed in his palm. He held it up between his
fingers and chuckled.
“Men have no concept of how their spirit, mind, and body are
interconnected. I have full access to this man’s soul. And with this
single word in the spirit, I can cause enzymes and chemicals and
neural pathways to shut down, open up, turn sideways.”
He gave the fireball a flick. It whistled across the room, hit
Herod, and disappeared within his flesh. All the demons watched
with wild eyes. Several minutes passed.
Beads of sweat formed on Herod’s brow. His face flushed. He
held his forearm up to his forehead, then dabbed it with a cloth.
Without a word, Herod jumped up from his throne, raced down the
platform, and wheeled around the thick floor–to–ceiling curtains
hanging behind the throne. All his attendants and officials looked
at each other with mouths open. They shrugged their shoulders.

Then the unmistakable sound of retching echoed through the silent
court.
Molech sat back on his throne and sneered. “As natural as carving
meat with a knife.”

Timrok’s sword crashed down on Lacidar’s sword, sending sparks
across the back yard of Rachael’s rebuilt house in Egypt. The force of
the impact made Lacidar stumble backward. Timrok leapt and landed
both feet on Lacidar’s chest. In an instant, Lacidar lay flat on his back,
the edge of Timrok’s blade hovered close against Lacidar’s stretched
neck, and Timrok’s knee pressed his full weight on Lacidar’s chest.
Timrok pulled his sword back with a flourish and jumped back
to his feet. He extended his hand and hoisted Lacidar up.
“You’re still being too mechanical,” Timrok said. “You need to
feel the motion of the fight as it unfolds.”
“Over four thousand years—you would think I could master
this. I’m a musician, not a warrior.”
Timrok looked at the sword in his own hand and shook his head.
“I never thought I would have to use one of these, either.”
Elric stepped around the corner of the house. “None of us did,”
he said. “But be of good cheer. The Day of the Lord is finally within
sight. Very soon, the King will set everything aright.”
“I am ready,” Lacidar said.
Timrok made a sudden joust. Lacidar blocked it with a sideways
parry.

277

“Until then,” Timrok said, “let’s sharpen your skills. I have an
idea for you. It is a technique I use often, and since you are a musician,
I think it might work for you.”
Lacidar took one step back and raised his sword.
Timrok said, “Sing for me one of your favorite songs. Something
upbeat with high energy.”
Lacidar cocked his head.
“Just do it.”
Lacidar paused for a moment. “Great is the Lord. Mighty are
His deeds,” he sang.
“Good! Good,” Timrok said. “I love that one. Now start again
and follow me.”
“Great is the Lord . . . ”
Tink, tink. Timrok’s sword struck Lacidar’s, and the steel rang
out like a bell.
“Mighty . . . ” Tink. “Are His . . . ” Tink, tink, tink, clang.
Timrok stepped back and smiled. “Do you hear it? Your sword is
your musical instrument. Instead of fighting me, sing your song and
play your instrument.”
A twinkle formed in Lacidar’s eyes. He lifted his sword and
launched into the full first verse. Each stroke of his sword punctuated
his song with perfect precision.
Timrok blocked each blow and shouted, “Excellent! Excellent!
Now, add your dance to the Lord.”
Lacidar leapt into the air with a spin and almost caught Timrok
with two of his well–timed thrusts. Lacidar’s feet sprang back off the
ground. He flipped backward in a tight somersault, landed, and spun
with a low pirouette in time with “establish justice and righteousness

forever.” His blade sliced a horizontal disc through space as he spun,
and it clipped Timrok just behind his knee.
Beams of light blasted out of the gash. Timrok dropped to one
knee with a surprised yelp.
Elric laughed and shouted, “Yes!”
Timrok’s wound sealed, and he stood.
“I am so sorry,” Lacidar said.
Timrok laughed, still trying to regain his strength. “I think this
technique might be helpful for you.”
“Why has no one shared this with me until now?”
The first rays of sunlight broke over the edge of the horizon. All
three turned toward the east. Out in the field to the east, Jenli sat
cross-legged, facing the sunrise with his dagger in his hand. As soon
as the sunrise appeared, he scraped the edge of the dagger across his
cheek and chin. He repeated on the other side. Then he shaved all the
stubble on the top of his head.
“When I first met him,” Elric said, “he had long, flowing, black
hair.”
“Why does he do that?” Timrok asked.
“It is his reason. And it is for him to tell.”
Jenli hopped to his feet and walked toward the house. Just before
he reached the house, a single point of light streaked in from the
north, low and fast. It was Zaben, and he alighted in front of Elric
just as Jenli arrived.
“We are gathered,” Elric said. “Let’s go inside.”
Once inside, Elric said, “Herod’s condition?”
“He continues to suffer severe stomach and colon pains,” Timrok
said. “He vomits almost everything he eats.”

Jenli said, “And Molech has struck him with something new. He
now has a skin condition all over his body. The itching is intolerable.
He tries hot baths and warm oil baths, but nothing helps.”
“The enemy is torturing the man,” Elric said. “These diseases are
not yet unto death. How is Herod responding? Is he able to hear the
calling of the Lord?”
Jenli shook his head. “No, sir. His personal strongholds are too
strong. None of the King’s words are penetrating. In fact, he curses
the Lord for his pain.”
Elric sighed. The four lieutenants’ gazes dropped to the floor.
“My heart aches for him. So blind. So imprisoned.” Elric sighed
again and lifted his chin. “Is the enemy raising up a successor?”
Zaben said, “The power struggle within the enemy ranks has
been building for some time. Again, the beaelzurim commanders
Molech, Asherah, and Yarikh maneuver for position.”
“Always these three. Who are each trying to promote?”
“Molech is in the best position right now because he owns Herod,
and he intends to install Herod’s son Antipater. Antipater is still away
at Rome, but he is the current heir according to Herod’s written will.
Asherah is trying to promote Archelaus. Yarikh is directing the ascent
of Philip. Other lesser powers are trying to promote some of Herod’s
other sons—Herod Antipas, Olympias, Herod, and Phasael—but it
appears one of the top three will emerge as the new prince over this
region.”
“I agree,” Jenli said. “And with Antipater away, Asherah and
Yarikh are working hard to discredit him before Herod. Herod can
sense the tensions, and the paranoia of losing his throne is driving
him mad.”

Elric shook his head and groaned. He looked over at Jesus
playing on the floor. A slight smile pulled up one corner of Elric’s lips.
“The day we await is in sight. All this pain and strife . . . ” He drew in
a deep breath and let it out. “Good work. Continue your operations.
Watch particularly for signs that will tell us timing.”
“In His service,” they replied in unison.

A month later, Elric and Lacidar stood behind Rachael’s house
and watched Mary and Jesus in the backyard garden.
“These four months have been very good for Joseph and Mary,”
Elric said to Lacidar. “Here there are no pursuers, no pressures, no
expectations. It’s just the two of them and their young toddler. He
learns new words every day and is discovering all the wonders of life.
He seems like any other little boy His age.”
“Joseph, you need to come here and see this,” Mary called out.
Her knees sank into a furrow of rich brown soil, and dirt covered her
hands.
Joseph circled around the back of the house, past the reconstructed
stable, and out to the plot of land he had prepared for a garden. By
the time he got there, Jenli, Zaben, and Timrok arrived.
Timrok stepped forward and said, “What are we—”
Elric held up his hand. Timrok stopped. The five angels watched
with twinkling eyes and silly grins. Mary knelt in the soil while Jesus
stood several steps in front of her in the middle of the trough.
“Watch this,” Mary said to Joseph.

She handed Jesus some seeds. He snatched them with His
chubby little hand and spun around with a squeal. He bounded
down the row, hardly able to contain His excitement, pulled a divot
of dirt aside with His empty hand, and placed the seeds into the hole.
Then with both hands, He covered the seeds with soil, stood straight
upright, and clapped. Joseph and Mary both clapped along.
“Isn’t it the cutest thing?” Mary said.
“It’s amazing,” Joseph said. “It is almost as though He understands
what that seed is to become.”
“He certainly loves planting seeds. And He doesn’t seem to get
tired of it. We are going to be out here all day.”
She handed Jesus some more seeds.
“You do know you could get the job done yourself in a tenth of
the time,” Joseph said.
“But He loves it so much.”
They both clapped again at another successful planting.
Joseph laughed and kissed her on the forehead. “Have fun, dear,”
he said. He turned and went back to his work.
Elric put his hands on his hips. “He may look like any other
little boy, but He is who He is.”
The others nodded.
“Come inside,” Elric said. “Let’s hear your reports.”
They all stepped through the back wall and into the quiet house.
“Herod’s abdomen is completely inflamed,” Timrok said. “Now
his feet and ankles are swollen and have broken out with lesions.
And Molech has struck him with gangrene of the genitals . . . with
worms.” Timrok paused and handled his swords. “Are you sure I can’t

Elric shook his head. “We have no authority in his life.”
“He has consulted every doctor,” Jenli said, “but there is no
remedy, no relief.”
“And is there anything new in the struggle for power?”
“Molech’s position weakens,” Zaben said. “Yarikh and Asherah
are reaching Herod through his other sons and attendants. The dark
secrets the enemy whispers in private are told to the king. He now
knows it was Antipater’s lies that drove Herod to kill two of his other
sons for treason. He also knows Antipater is trying to build support
for a coup and actually tried to poison him.”
“It will not go well for Antipater when he returns from Rome,”
Elric said.

A

small gray lizard crept up the wall behind the heavy curtains
in Herod’s throne room. It poked its head out, just enough
to see into the court. Molech stood in front of his throne,

facing away from the court with his massive arms crossed.

“Send in Asherah and Yarikh,” Molech announced with a
commanding rumble.
Two hulking beaelzur commanders sauntered into the room.
Their statures matched Molech’s, and their crusty hands gripped their
sword handles. Their faces contorted with disdain.
283

Molech continued facing away and waited for Asherah and
Yarikh to reach their place. He lifted his chin. “Herod has discovered
the secret doings of Antipater,” Molech said. He exhaled a thin
line of sulfurous smoke through his turned-up nostrils. “And now
Antipater is on his way back from Rome to answer for crimes against
the throne.” He turned, glared at Asherah and Yarikh, and sat with
pompous deliberation. “I don’t suppose either of you know how word
of Antipater’s actions would have reached Herod?”
Without hesitation, Yarikh said, “I did it.”
“It was me,” said Asherah.
Molech gave an indifferent flip of his wrist. “It doesn’t matter. I
will put Antipater on the throne, and none of your feeble tactics will
stop me. Even if I have to kill Herod now before he changes his will,
I will do what is necessary. Know this, neither of you will prevail.”
Yarikh and Asherah each grunted and walked out of the throne
room.
The small gray lizard blinked and continued watching.

Elric and Zaben pored over the war map in Hannah’s house.
The ever–changing landscape of politics, natural events, and enemy
activities swirled through the colors of the map.
“Look,” Zaben said, “Herod is moving to his palace in Jericho
tomorrow.”
“M-hmm,” Elric replied, distracted by another area of the
map—out around the edges where things weren’t as clear. “Every day

I search for answers. Slowly, things are coming into focus, and the
pieces of our timetable are starting to fall into place.”
Zaben joined Elric at the edge of the map.
“We will not have as much time in Egypt as I had hoped,” Elric
said. “It appears Herod only has about six months left.”
“And his successor?”
“It appears his kingdom will be divided into three.”
“Molech, Yarikh, and Asherah.”
“Yes, the power will be divided between them. None of the three
will be the sole prince.”
Zaben bit his lip and nodded his head. “This is excellent. This
will work to our advantage. When Jesus begins His campaign, we will
be able to concentrate on taking one part of the kingdom at a time.”
“Indeed. And there is a more immediate benefit. Look over here.
The struggle to establish their power bases after Herod’s death will
create great disarray. All the subordinate forces will be distracted by
realigning allegiances.”
“That will be our opportunity to slip back into Israel.”
Elric waved his hand over the map. It disappeared like a mist.
“We will not move until the King gives His word, but yes, I
believe it will be in this time.”

A plain gray dove alighted on the stone banister of Herod’s third
palace in Jericho in the afternoon sun. It cocked its head to one side
and watched.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Herod’s attendants carried him in his chair from his bedchambers
to the balcony overlooking the enclosed courtyard. Three sides of
the courtyard were lined with majestic columns with red and black
painted bottoms, grooved plaster tops, and Ionic capitals. The fourth
end of the courtyard had a semicircular plaza where forty prisoners
huddled together at spear-point of two dozen Roman soldiers. The
ragged group of dissidents below on the cobblestone courtyard
looked insignificant and pathetic in their chains. The demons who
had stirred the uprising for which the men stood accused snaked
around the men, sneering and launching accusations at them.
Molech stood at the edge of balcony and called down to the
demons in the courtyard, “This is a most excellent gift you bring.
Your dedication to my regime will be rewarded once I reassert my
throne after Herod’s passing.”
Molech stepped backward and sat down within Herod.
Herod coughed, sat up straight, and drew in a shallow wheezing
breath.
Herod’s court official stepped forward and unrolled a scroll.
He spoke. “Primus pilus, Chief Centurion, Commander of the First
Cohort, Roman Legion, Jerusalem. To his royal highness, the most
excellent King Herod, King of Israel, to whom my most humble
allegiance remains, greetings.” The court official paused and cleared
his throat. “Whereas the Jewish teachers Matthias and Judas have
conspired to incite rebellion amongst the people, and inasmuch as
this group of zealous students have followed Matthias and Judas in
the treachery of pulling down, defacing, and burning the royal eagle
ordained by the honorable King of Israel to adorn the outside of
the main temple gate, I deemed it expedient to seize the dissidents

to prevent further uprisings and to detain them until appropriate
judgment could be made. By reason of the capital nature of this
offense, I send the accused under armed guard to the royal palace at
Jericho to stand before the king for final adjudication. May the king
rule in justice. May the king live forever.” The official rolled the scroll
and stepped back.
Herod pulled his shoulders up and back and took in a strained
breath. He winced and fought back a convulsion in his arm.
“Burned my eagle?” he shouted loud enough for the men in
the courtyard to hear. “Burned my eagle? You had the audacity to
deface my—your own—temple? Do you have any defense against
these accusations?”
Matthias stepped forward. The chains around his ankles jingled
across the ground.
“Hear, o king, the words of righteous men, accused of a righteous
act. Since the days of the holy man of God, Moses, the law of God
strictly forbids the worship of any graven image. This eagle, which
you have affixed to the house of God, is an abomination. It defiles
the temple. It defiles the people. The leaders in the Sanhedrin have
made petition to you, but you would not hear. It was therefore our
righteous duty—”
“Treason!” Herod shouted. His words echoed off the walls of
the courtyard. “I find you all guilty of nothing less than treason!”
“What shall the punishment be, your highness?” the official
asked.
“Burn them,” Molech said from within Herod.
The gray dove on the banister ruffled its feathers and stepped
side to side along the banister rail.

288

“Burn them alive,” Herod said through strained breath. “They
burned my eagle. They shall suffer the same fate. Do it right here
in this court before me. I want to see their flesh consumed by the
flames.”
The condemned prisoners stood by, and the Roman soldiers
brought wood into the courtyard, building up the mound for the fire.
The soldiers raised thick, tall logs upright and lashed them together
into a cylindrical bundle at the center of the mound. They heaped up
stacks of timber around the center until the mound stood several feet
high. They saturated the entire pile with oil. The preparation took
hours to complete, and the prisoners grew faint from the onslaught
of the demons tearing at their minds.
The soldiers forced the condemned to climb the pile. One of the
students resisted, but a guard ran him through with his sword and
tossed his lifeless body onto the kindling. The other men clambered
up the mound, stepping over and around him. The soldiers lashed
them all to the center bundle of logs with thick chains around their
chests and ankles.
With all the preparations complete, an attendant summoned
Herod from his chambers. Once positioned on the balcony of power,
Herod raised his right hand, and a deathly silence fell over the entire
place. He waited several moments, glaring down at the men. The
demons in the courtyard danced around the mound in a frenzy.
Herod spoke. His voice sounded low and guttural and didn’t
even sound human, “Light the fire.”
The gray dove jumped from the banister and swooped downward
into the courtyard. It leveled off, circled twice, and flew back to its
place on the rail.

289

The flames shot high into the air, and the screams of forty men
in writhing agony filled the courtyard. The demons danced among
the flames and frolicked all about the bonfire. They started at the base
of the mound and streaked upward with the flames while swooping
their wings up the front of the men’s burning flesh—as though licking
up the pain as the flames tore at the men’s skin. The screams lasted
several minutes, but then, one by one they became replaced by the
crackling sounds of the well–fueled fire. When the screams ceased
and the smoldering figures stopped moving, Herod gestured with his
shaking hand, and his attendants carried him back to his chambers.
Molech stepped out of his host and stood at the edge of the
balcony. He closed his eyes and breathed in the smell of burning flesh.
One of Molech’s captains said, “Almost like the days of old,
master?”
Molech smiled. “It is not as satisfying as infant sacrifices offered
in my name.” He took in another deep breath. “But it is very good.”
The gray dove on the banister left its perch and fluttered off
toward the south.

“Possibly. Although we know they are all blinded by jealousy

“You two should come out and see this,” Lacidar said.
“What is it?” Elric asked.
“Come see.”
Elric, Jenli, and Lacidar stepped out back into the morning

“He will do it,” Zaben said.
“No, He won’t,” Timrok said.
Elric wedged between them and turned his head left, then right.
“What is the great debate?”
“Jesus is helping Mary pull weeds,” Zaben said. “Even at this
age, He seems to understand the difference between a weed and the
crop.”
Jesus ran down His row, stopped at a weed, gave a vigorous yank,
shouted “Aha” at the upturned roots in his hand, and laughed all the
way to Mary, where he laid the weed in a neat little pile.
Elric laughed. “I see. What, then, is the controversy?”
“See this weed on the end of His row?” Zaben said. “It’s partially
wrapped around the good plant’s stalk. If He pulls it, it might damage
the good plant. But the weed needs to come out. I say He will do

“No, He won’t,” Timrok said.

Timrok and Elric looked at each other and shook their heads.
“No, He won’t do it,” Elric said. “He will not take the chance of
harming the good plant. He may only be a boy, but He is still who
He is.”
Jesus came upon the weed in question and stopped cold. He
paused. He reached down and fingered the weed.
“See? See? He is going to do it,” Zaben whispered.
Jesus stood back up. He paused again. Then, He bounded off to
another weed.
“Ha!” Timrok shouted. He reached across Elric and smacked
Zaben’s shoulder. “I knew He wouldn’t do it!”
Zaben grumbled under his breath. “I would have at least cut it
out.” He took a swing with his sword.
They all laughed.
Elric said, “Our easy days in Egypt are almost over. Herod’s time
is nearly done, and soon we will need to move Jesus back into the

He passed a small gray lizard that hid in the inconspicuous

shadows of the corner. The lizard cocked its head so one beady eye could
watch the room. Antipater reached out toward his father, but Herod
stopped him.

“Even this is an indication of your murderous intents. Would

under heinous accusations. Do not touch me until you clear yourself
of the crimes that are charged upon you.”

Antipater stumbled backward, and horror washed over his face.
“What charges, my lord?”
“You lied about your half-brothers, Alexander and Aristobulus,
resulting in their executions by my hand. Their blood is on your

you tried to poison me.”
“No, Father. I am innocent of these accusations. These are all lies
fabricated by those who wish to see me brought down.”
Yarikh and Asherah bounded in through the front wall of the
court, flanked by their loyal captains. Molech looked up but turned
his attention back to Herod.
“You should listen to your son,” Molech spoke to Herod. “These
accusations are unfounded. Lies of your enemies. Antipater is your
eldest son—you should trust him.”
Molech’s words shot into Herod’s spirit like arrows into warm
butter. Herod sat back in his throne and rubbed his eyes with his
shaking hands. He propped himself up so he could breathe.
Yarikh and Asherah shouted accusations into the air of the
Middle Realm.
“He tried to kill you!”
“All he wants is your throne!”
“He’s a liar and traitor!”
Their words pounded Herod’s spirit.
“Enough!” roared Molech. “Remove these antagonists from my

Two dozen demon captains drew their swords and converged on
Yarikh and Asherah.

“Enough!” shouted Herod. “You are a liar and a traitor to the
throne. I appoint you to court where you are to be judged. Prepare
your defense against tomorrow, for I give you so much time to prepare
suitable excuses for yourself. Remove him to prison.”
Roman guards seized his arms and dragged him out of the court.
All the way, Antipater screamed, “This is a mistake. I’m innocent.
There is no proof. Listen to—”
The thick arched-top wooden doors slammed shut, and all
turned quiet.
An attendant approached the throne. “My lord, with the weight
of evidence against him, he is sure to be found guilty. When shall the
execution be completed?”
Molech buried his face in his hands. The yellow smoke from his
breath seeped around his fingers. “Not now,” he said. “I need time.”
Herod sat up and struggled for a breath. “Not now,” he said.
“Later, when I am stronger. Right now, I must have rest.”
Molech ground his teeth. He turned to his captains. “We are out

A large gray moth fluttered across Herod’s lamp-lit bedchamber
and alighted on a marble pillar. As still as stone, it disappeared against
the gray streaks of the marble.
“It is working, my lord,” the beaelzurim captain said to Molech.
“By your word, Herod grows sicker and weaker every day. He is far
too weak to make changes to his will.”
“Yes, but even more, his thoughts grow darker and more hopeless.
I believe I finally have him ready. It is time.”
Molech disappeared within Herod.
Herod called out with an inhuman sound, a gasping crackle.
“Attendant.”
The door opened.
“Bring me an apple. I should like to try to eat something. And
bring me a knife that I might pare the apple.”
The attendant bowed and left the room. He returned with an
entire basket of apples and a paring knife and left the king alone.
“Now, do it! End this misery,” Molech commanded Herod.
Herod picked up the knife with his right hand and looked
around the room. He raised the knife.
“Do it!” repeated Molech.
Yarikh emerged through the bedchamber door. He kept
whispering behind him, “Hurry, hurry, hurry.” Yarikh whisked across
the room and hid behind a marble column. The gray moth crept to
the other side of the column.
The bedroom door cracked open, and an attendant announced
quietly, “Master, your cousin, Achiabus, is here to see to the King’s

“Quickly, quickly,” Yarikh shouted.

Yarikh shouted, “Ha ha!” and disappeared through the wall.

tried to bribe the guard into setting him free with promises of amnesty
and rewards once he was on the throne. But when the chief jailer
heard of it, he went with the news directly to Herod, who naturally
had a fit of rage and ordered an immediate execution, right in his jail
cell, so the executioner—”
“Antipater is dead,” Zaben said.
Timrok’s animated arms fell to his sides, and he looked at Zaben
with his mouth still open.
Elric nodded with a smirk and asked, “What of Molech?”

DEATH OF A KING

“He has disappeared,” Jenli said. “We presume he is working to
gain the promotion of one of Herod’s other sons, but we do not know
who.”
“Yes,” Elric said, “he will not give up so easily.”
“Neither will Yarikh and Asherah,” Zaben said. “All three are
battling for the mind of Herod. This is a crucial time.”
***
The next day the gray moth took its position on the marble
column in Herod’s personal chambers. The room was well-lit and
filled with courtiers and officials. Herod sat, propped up in a tall–
backed chair, shaking and fighting a convulsive cough. Asherah,
Yarikh, and Molech stood across from Herod, silent and anxious.
Herod made his announcement, interrupted by his frequent
coughing.
“Due . . . to the traitorous . . . actions of Antipater, I . . . am
forced to revise . . . my will and to bequeath my kingdom to . . . a
more worthy son . . . before there is . . . murderous anarchy among
my heirs. Let it be known before these . . . witnesses that it is my
wish . . . that the entirety of the kingdom . . . be given to . . . upon my
passing, and not before . . . to . . . my son Herod Antipas.”
In the human world, all the attendants gasped and whispered
among themselves.
In the Middle Realm, Asherah and Yarikh exploded upon
Molech. Before their swords could reach him, Molech shouted, “Ha
ha!” and shot up through the roof.

One of Herod’s most trusted advisors stepped forward and
whispered to the king. “Your highness, Archelaus is the older brother.
We naturally assumed you would—”
“Cunning . . . he is,” Herod said. “He has an eye toward . . . my
throne. I am . . . tired of treacherous . . . sons. Antipas is . . . the more
faithful. He . . . is my choice.”
Herod dismissed his court, rose out of the chair, and struggled
back to his bed.
***
Three days later, Herod’s room filled again with advisors, legal
officials, and attendants. The silent gray moth hid on the gray veins
of the marble. A gray mouse huddled in a corner. A small snake with
a black forked tongue slithered behind the curtains.
Asherah, Yarikh, and Molech all stood motionless, waiting to
hear Herod’s words.
“I have been . . . deliberating over three of my . . . sons, Antipas,
Archelaus . . . and Philip, as to which one is worthy . . . to rule over
my kingdom . . . after my passing.”
The three demons glared at one another.
“I have decided that . . . none . . . of these has the stature
to . . . maintain so large a kingdom with the . . . skill that I have
demonstrated over many . . . years. I have therefore decided . . . to
divide the kingdom up . . . among the three.”
“Archelaus shall be named . . . king over most of my kingdom . . .
Idumaea, Judea, and Samaria.”

“Philip . . . shall be named tetrarch over . . . Ituraea and
Trachonitis in the northeast.”
“And Antipas shall be . . . named tetrarch over Galilee and . . .
the east bank of the Jordan.”
“I have made my wishes known . . . in the presence of all these
witnesses. Prepare the legal documents . . . and ready them for my . . .
certification. Upon my death, you . . . must send these documents
to . . . Rome to be confirmed by the emperor.”
Without a word, Molech, Asherah and Yarikh walked out of the
room in three different directions.
***
The next day, at a special meeting of Elric’s team, the four
lieutenants stood around him in the center of Joseph and Mary’s
room at Rachel’s family home in Egypt. Timrok bounced from foot
to foot; Jenli scrawled something on a ledger; Zaben bit his lip; and
Lacidar waited with his chin up and arms crossed.
Elric broke the tension. “Report?”
Timrok’s pent up energy gushed out. “There is so much to tell
you today.”
“Only one thing that matters,” Zaben said under his breath.
Timrok stopped bouncing and motioned with his hand to
Zaben.
“Herod the Great is dead,” Zaben said.

With supper finished, Daniel’s family congregated in the main
living area of their home in Nazareth. Daniel occupied his regular
spot, isolated in the corner. His vacant eyes stared into nothingness.
Vorsogh crouched low where he whispered poison into Daniel’s spirit.
Vorsogh paused his dark works when there came an insistent rapping
at the front door. Jeremiah rose and answered it. He greeted the man
at the door with a warm hug and a kiss on each cheek.
“Yadid, my friend, what brings you out this pleasant evening?”
Jeremiah said.
“Have you heard the news?” Yadid asked.
“No, I have heard no news. Come in, come in.”
Jeremiah closed the door and motioned for Yadid to sit.
“Can I get you a cup of water? Here, have some dates.”
“No, thank you,” Yadid said. “I am here only long enough to
share the good news.”
“Good news? How blessed are the feet of those who bring good
news. Let us have this news.”
“King Herod is dead,” Yadid said.
“What?” Jeremiah covered his open mouth with his hand and
looked at Yadid with unbelieving eyes.
“It is true. Confirmed by the mouths of multiple witnesses.”
Everyone in the room, except Daniel, leapt to their feet with a
shout. Jeremiah grabbed Ruth and danced her across the room. They
all laughed and hugged.
Vorsogh touched Daniel on the back of his head with two
fingers. Daniel still had a thin layer of light as a breastplate from the
innocence of his youth, but Daniel’s thoughts of late had formed a

301

very nice helmet of darkness. Vorsogh avoided the breastplate and
only touched the stronghold of darkness.
“A shallow celebration,” Vorsogh whispered to Daniel. His words
formed numbing needles that pierced into Daniel’s spirit. “There is
no true justice in this. Herod never paid for the slaughter of those
innocent children.”
Daniel scowled and pursed his lips.
“Never mind the cup of water,” Jeremiah shouted. “This calls for
wine!”
Jeremiah poured a cup of wine and said, “Sit, Yadid, sit. You
must tell us everything you have heard.”
Yadid sat and took a sip of wine. “As I understand it, the whole
country is celebrating. Not openly, of course. But the people are glad.”
“Praise be to God,” Jeremiah said, lifting his cup of wine.
Vorsogh sneered. “There is no praise due any god. If there was
a God, He would have destroyed Herod before he killed all those
babies—before his soldiers killed Levi.” His words sank deep into
Daniel’s spirit.
Yadid took another drink. “I heard Herod was afraid no one
would mourn at his death. I heard he was holding all the prominent
men in Israel at his palace in Jericho with orders to have them all
executed upon his death. That way, every family in Israel would have
reason to mourn.”
Ruth gasped. “He was an evil monster.”
“What has become of the men?” Jeremiah asked.
“Herod’s sister was the one charged by Herod to carry out his
order. She did not do it, though. She released them all.”
“Thank God,” Ruth said.

Yadid glanced toward Daniel and leaned in close to Jeremiah.
“What is the matter with your boy?” Yadid whispered. “I think he has
not blinked once since I’ve been here.”
Jeremiah leaned into Yadid and turned his head away from
Daniel. “He has been like this since Levi was killed. It has been very
difficult for all of us, but Daniel has taken it the worst. He has become
very distant. He rarely speaks. He is not well. We keep hoping he will
get better.”
Vorsogh whispered to Daniel. “They are talking about you. They
think they are so superior to you. They don’t understand your pain.”
Daniel blinked once and continued staring into nothingness.

lric stepped back from the war map and crossed his arms.
Zaben, Lacidar, Timrok, and Jenli stood on the opposite side
along the wall of Hannah’s house.

“Most of the turmoil among the human powers will be settled
once Caesar confirms Herod’s final will,” Elric said. “And it appears
he will. What do your teams see within the enemy camps?”
“The darkness in Judea under Asherah is strong,” Lacidar said.
“Asherah used Archelaus to murder three thousand Pharisees who
opposed him and has imprisoned hundreds of political rivals. The
army that backed Herod now stands behind Archelaus. He is at least

304

as ruthless as his father. And Asherah has much to prove to secure his
position.”
“Molech is still staggering from his losses,” Timrok said. “He
continues to try to promote Antipas, but he seems to recognize
his sphere of power is lost. And so do his followers. Many of the
beaelzurim who served under him for the last half century are not
interested in the region of Galilee. They are trying to align themselves
with Asherah.”
Zaben said, “And the forces already loyal to Asherah do not
welcome those who will dilute their own spheres of power. There are
many clashes.”
Elric nodded and rubbed his chin. “Securing the loyalties of
officers is a thorny proposition when self-serving ambitions are the
rule.”
“Yarikh faces similar problems to Molech’s,” Jenli said. “Few
of the beaelzur captains are willing to limit their activity to the
northeastern region, and they are challenging the regional powers
throughout Judea for authority within Asherah’s regime.”
“This is exactly the disorder we expected,” Elric said. He stepped
forward into the map and bent his neck to see into the swirling layers
of color. “All the churning of the power struggles leaves the enemy
preoccupied and in disarray.”
He stepped back and motioned with his hand. The map
disappeared.
“They do not seek the Son of Man,” he said.
“There is still no word from the Throne?” Zaben asked.
“No, but I expect we will—”

An explosion of light flashed. Without a sound Grigor appeared
before Elric. The sweet fragrance of Holy Spirit filled the air.
“A word of the Lord,” Grigor said.
Elric bowed his head once.
“Out of Egypt I now call my Son. Bring Him up into the land
of Israel. There I will train Him up and prepare Him for the work
He must do. The Passover is seven days hence. You shall begin the
journey on the morning after Passover.”
“In His service,” Elric said.
Grigor’s eyes darted around at the lieutenants, and he
flashed a quick smile. “By His word.” He unfurled his wings and
disappeared.

The moon was nearly full, and as it made its course across the
cloudless sky, it gave a gentle blue luster to the Egyptian landscape.
Joseph and Mary’s bedroom was dark. Crickets sang their lullaby.
Jesus slept. Quiet stillness nestled over all.
Joseph had slipped into the hazy space between conscious
thought and dreamless slumber when he noticed a tiny light in the
distance. The light emerged from the backdrop of his mind and
became a small translucent white bird. It made a graceful flight
toward him, and Joseph extended his hand—an invitation, a landing
place for the bird. It drew near. That’s not a bird—but a man with
agile, flowing wings.
I feel like I’m awake. I’m standing. And my eyes are wide open.

306

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Joseph lowered his hand and took a step back. The figure alighted
in front of Joseph and smiled. The two stood face to face, enveloped
in a misty white cloud.
The peaceful warmth of the mist wrapped around Joseph like a
blanket. He looked into the eyes of the visitor.
This man looks familiar. He reminds me of the angel who delivered
the message to flee to Egypt.
The angel spoke. “Get up, take the Child and His mother, and
go to the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child’s life are dead.”
Joseph breathed a long sigh. The nagging fear of someone
showing up unexpectedly to do Jesus harm floated away into the
mist. This last year in Egypt had been so restful—but he knew this
day would come eventually.
“Yes, my lord,” Joseph said. “When shall we depart, and how
quickly do we need to travel?”
“Haste on the journey is not required. However, you are to
depart on the morning of Passover next week.”
“Travel on a high holy Sabbath? Should we not wait until after
the Feast of Unleavened Bread is complete?”
“This is the word of the Lord to you. Make your preparations for
Passover. Prepare enough matzo for your journey. You may celebrate
the Passover seder with your relatives Benjamin and Rachael, but you
must depart on the following morning.”
“Yes, my lord.”
The angel turned and flew away just as he had entered. He
became smaller in the distance, like a small bird, and all the light
drew toward him like a pinpoint magnet. As the light receded, it
pulled the very breath from Joseph’s lungs.

Joseph sat bolt upright. He gasped.
His bedroom sat dark and still. He strained his eyes for the
spiritual presence he knew was there. Nothing. He and Mary and
Jesus were alone. He nudged Mary.
“Mary, I just had another vision from Lord. It’s time to return
to Israel.”
***
Elric, Zaben, Lacidar, Jenli, and Timrok stood like timeless
statues around the Passover table at Benjamin and Rachael’s house
within the palace grounds. The table had been prepared according
to Jewish custom, with the roasted Passover lamb, unleavened bread,
and bitter herbs. Elric stood behind the empty seat reserved for the
Messiah with his arms crossed. The ceremony began.
After Benjamin performed the Yachatz, Joseph turned to Jesus
and whispered, “Now is the time. Just like we practiced. Ask your
question—good and loud.”
Jesus sat up tall and said with a squeaky little voice, “Why is this
night different from all other nights?”
Joseph and Mary smiled at Him and nodded their approval.
“This is a very good question, young man,” Benjamin said. “I
am glad you have asked it. Let me tell you the story of Moses and the
miraculous deliverance of Israel from bondage in Egypt.”
The angels nodded with wise, ancient smiles as Benjamin
recounted the story of Moses. Elric closed his eyes. For the humans
retelling this narrative—which they had only heard through
generations of oral tradition—this ceremony served as a way to

308

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

connect with their heritage and remember how God had intervened
once upon a time.
But not for Elric. He was there. He battled hard against an
enemy entrenched behind an unbreakable stronghold—the great
demon prince, Ra, and his commanders, Hathor, Horus, Isis, Sobek,
and the others who held that land back then. Elric gritted his teeth.
“Then, Moses said to Pharaoh,” Benjamin continued, “‘The
Lord, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, “Let My
people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness. But behold, you
have not listened until now.” Thus says the Lord, “By this you shall
know that I am the Lord: behold, I am going to strike the water that
is in the Nile with the staff that is in my hand, and it will be turned
into blood.”’”
I can still see it—the banks of the Nile when Moses struck the
waters with his staff. Ra and his minions lined the opposite bank and
defied the army of the Lord and the Lord’s servant Moses. The Lord
turned the water into blood, and Ra snorted with spite. He used
Pharaoh’s magicians. They poured large clay pitchers of water onto
the ground before Pharaoh, and Ra turned that water into blood
and laughed. The hardest part to watch wasn’t the haughty rebellion
of the enemy. It wasn’t even the death of everything in the river. It was
the hardness of Pharaoh himself. He wore his stronghold of darkness
like a stone wall. When Moses spoke the words of the King, the
words wrapped around Pharaoh, pressing to get in. But Pharaoh’s
armor was too strong. And then, the saddest part—the light from
the Lord’s rejected words faded, turned to darkness, and clung to
the outside of Pharaoh’s spiritual armor, making it even harder than
before.

OUT OF EGYPT

309

Benjamin told the story of each of the ten plagues the Lord used
to break Pharaoh, and Elric replayed in his mind his own role during
each one. Benjamin reached the final plague. Elric’s eyes welled up. I
can still feel the tension of that night as the Hebrews applied the blood of
lambs to their doorposts and hid behind those doors. And the sorrow of
watching the death of every firstborn male in every house that didn’t
have the lamb’s blood on their door, including Pharaoh’s. And the
anticipation of the battle to be fought the next morning.
But then the glorious victory when, after 400 years of bondage,
the entire nation of Israelites left Egypt. Elric laughed aloud through
his tears. By the King’s hand and the unseen army of elzurim, the
King extracted the Israelites right out from under the beaelzurim’s
grip. Elric led Company 12 of Legion 5 on the left flank of the Pillar
of Fire until the nation of Israel had crossed the Red Sea.
Elric wiped his eyes and looked around the room. Jenli and
Lacidar wiped their eyes. Zaben bit his lip. Timrok had both hands
on his swords and a big, stupid grin on his face.
Elric cleared his throat. “That story never gets old,” he said.
The lieutenants nodded.
Zaben stopped biting his lip and crossed his arms. “Do you
realize what tomorrow is?”
Everyone shook their heads.
“It’s day 400! Jesus has been in Egypt 400 days! And we are leading
Him out on the morning of Passover. It has to mean something.” He
looked toward Elric. “Has the Lord given you anything about this?”
“No. It is interesting.” Elric paused for a few seconds. “But I
would not read too much into it. Jesus was not in bondage here. We
are not bound for the Red Sea, and we are certainly not going to

Mount Sinai. We will never be east of the Jordan, so we will have no
need to cross it, and I do not anticipate even getting close to Jericho.
No, I think He has called His Son out of Egypt just like He did the
nation of Israel, but I do not see that parallel affecting our plans for
the journey.”
Zaben forced a slow nod. “We may not be at the Red Sea seven
days from now, but I think we should be on our guard. These days do
not line up by accident.”
“Mmm,” Elric said, rubbing his chin.
The humans prepared for bed.
“Status of your teams,” Elric said. “Lacidar?”
“In Judea with Zacharias, Elizabeth, and John. We are ready.”
“Jenli?”
“Preparations in Nazareth are complete.”
“Zaben?”
“Already in strategic positions along the route. All is quiet.”
“Timrok?”
“We are ready for escort. We will not be seen, but we will be all
around you.”
“Very good. Tomorrow we move.”

Joseph cinched a rope holding down a large coarse linen–
wrapped bundle on the back of the donkey cart. Benjamin watered
the donkey. Sunrise drew near.
“It’s strange leaving Egypt on the morning of Passover,” Joseph
said. “It almost feels . . . somehow . . . historic. Do you suppose it
means anything?”

“I don’t know,” Benjamin said. “Are you sure you are to be
traveling at all? This is supposed to be a holy day.”
“I have specific orders from the Lord. If He says to travel, who
am I to question?”
“At least you’re not leading an entire nation out of Egypt.”
“This is a good thing. I am no Moses.”
Benjamin laughed. “And you do not have Pharaoh chasing you.”
“That is a good thing, too.”
“Of course, if you want people to write books about you and
talk about you throughout the generations, you have to do something
truly remarkable.”
“I have no need for the remarkable. Here, pull down on this
rope on the other side there. Good. Now tie that one off. I think we
are ready.”
“Are you sure you will not wait for a few days?” Benjamin said.
“There is a caravan headed north that you could join.”
“No, the last time we joined up with a caravan, it did not go
well. Besides, we were specifically told to—”
“I know, I know. You are supposed to leave this morning. Look,
here comes Mary and Rachael and the boys.”
“We are so sad to see you leave,” Rachael said.
“Thank you,” Mary said. “Your gracious kindness toward us will
remain in our hearts forever.”
“It has been a very good year,” Joseph said. He grabbed Benjamin’s
shoulders. “Thank you. Thank you.” They hugged.
“The blessing has been ours,” Benjamin said.
Rachael and Mary hugged. Joseph hugged Rachael and Benjamin
hugged Mary.

312

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

The two boys watched all the hugging. They hugged each other.
The adults all laughed. Rachael and Mary dabbed their eyes.
“Come now,” Joseph said, lifting Jesus to his hip. “It’s time to
go.”
Rachael stepped forward and put her hand around the back of
Jesus’ neck and head. She looked into His eyes and smiled. She kissed
his forehead.
Joseph walked to the donkey cart and hoisted Jesus onto the
back of it.
The journey began. Joseph led with his handcart; Mary walked
beside the donkey; and Jesus bounced around in the donkey cart
wearing His favorite tunic and waving to everyone they passed.
He acted like every person He saw was some long–lost best friend,
and He waved and waved to get their attention. Some smiled and
waved back, which made Him laugh. Others were too busy or too
sophisticated to be bothered by Him and passed by—working hard
not to make eye contact. He didn’t seem to notice. He just waved to
the next person.
Six days of a dusty trail passed. Eating the matzo for every meal
became monotonous, but it turned out to be good for travel. As the
sun set, beginning the seventh day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,
Joseph set up their makeshift camp beneath a stand of palms and
“enjoyed” some more matzo bread in celebration of the feast.
“I think we are not far from Gaza,” Joseph said. “But we should
rest here the entire day tomorrow to observe the holy day.”
Mary nodded.
It was a starry night, skirted with palm silhouettes, and
accompanied by a stout southward breeze.

Joseph lay on his back gazing at the stars. “This is the night when
the Lord parted the Red Sea. Out here in the wilderness, you can
almost imagine what it must have been like—the Red Sea on one side
and Pharaoh’s army on the other.”
***
While Joseph, Mary, and Jesus slept, Elric, Timrok, and Zaben
stood guard on high alert. Thoughts of the Red Sea deliverance filled
Elric’s imagination. He scanned the horizon in every direction for any
signs of pursuers. Nothing. The night appeared quiet.

full midnight moon glowed over the temple ruins in the
ancient city of Babylon. Marr headquartered there amid
the old stone pillars of the main temple court. Molech,

Asherah, and Yarikh stood just beyond the reach of Marr’s sword but
several steps in from the ring of fire that surrounded the entire throne
room with them in the middle. The flames burned bright red and
orange at the base, while blue tips shot thirty feet in the air, blocking
out all onlookers and locking in the three commanders. Marr’s voice
rumbled across the stone floor as he roared, “I don’t care about your

petty squabbles and maneuvering for power. None of that matters
compared to our primary goal—to find and kill the Son of Man. Have
you forgotten our mandate?”

The three commanders glowered at each other and shot angry,
spiteful glares toward Marr.
“My troops have scoured all of Israel and have found nothing,”
Molech said with defiance.
Marr growled and sat forward on his throne. “Fools! Could it be
that He is not in Israel?”
The three commanders continued to glare at Marr with their
chins up and teeth clenched. None answered the question. He led
them with another. “He disappeared just as we converged on His
location in Bethlehem, right? And you cannot find Him anywhere
in Israel, right?” Marr paused and tapped his talon on the throne
armrest. He shook his head. “And there are prophecies that say He
will come up out of Egypt.”
The lights went on the commanders’ eyes. Simultaneously they
muttered, “He must be in Egypt!”
Marr sneered. “While you three were so consumed with carving
out positions within my realm, you let the Son of Man slip down to
Egypt and hide there for over a year!”
Asherah forced a sharp puff of hot smoke out of his nostrils.
Yarikh curled his upper lip and showed one of his filthy fangs. Molech
crossed his massive arms.
Marr clenched the armrests of his throne. Flames shot out from
between his strained fingers. “Here is what you are going to do,” he
said. “Choose ten worthy beaelzur captains under your commands.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

316

Each of them will muster 100 beaelzur warriors. Then, they are all to
go to Egypt and find the Son of Man. And they shall not return until
He is found.”
The three commanders glanced at each other with contempt and
looked away.
“I don’t care where the forces come from.” Marr said. “They
all belong to me. If the three of you cannot accomplish this order
together, I can find more capable commanders.”
“It shall be done,” Molech said with a raspy tone.
“I thought so. Move quickly—I want the entire army mobilized
by dawn.”
Marr raised his right hand and slowly brought it back down. The
ringed wall of fire dropped, responding to his arm’s position until the
fire smothered out at the same time his hand returned to its resting
place on the throne.
The three commanders turned and flew off.
***
Just before dawn, one of Zaben’s forward scouts came blazing
into camp.
“The enemy is coming! A whole legion is headed this way!”
Seconds later, one of Timrok’s team arrived with the same news.
One by one within the next two minutes, all of Zaben and Timrok’s
teams appeared with frantic reports of an incoming horde.
Elric looked down at the three humans—sleeping, unaware of
the dangerous evil about to wash over them. He had tried to develop
a plan for this eventuality all night, but he never came up with a

THE RED SEA

317

suitable way out. They had no cover within miles. No place to hide.
No place to run.
He took stock of his team—twelve warriors, plus himself, and
all had already taken defensive battle-stances around Jesus with their
resolute faces turned toward the north. Timrok stood in front. They
are ready to fight to protect the King, but we don’t have the numbers to
wage a successful battle.
Elric slid his sword into its sheath and got down on one knee.
“Lord, we need your help,” he said.
The memory of an ancient defeat sent a spark of pain through
his head, and his left eyebrow and upper cheek muscles squeezed two
involuntary blinks. He instinctively hid his secret pain behind his
hand. He looked up to see if a legion of the King’s warriors would
descend to join the battle. He remained down on one knee for a full
minute, waiting for reinforcements.
Without a sound, Grigor shot down into the camp and landed in
front of him. The two talked privately, and then Grigor disappeared
as quickly as he had arrived. Elric turned to address the team.
“Put your weapons away,” he said. “We will not need to fight
today. Today, the Lord Himself will deliver us from our enemy.”
They all sheathed their swords without hesitation and turned
back to the north. Timrok complied too, but his face gave away his
disappointment.
As the rising sun lit the eastern horizon and set it ablaze in red,
the fast–moving clouds from the north became visible to the elzur
forces surrounding the little human camp. The black clouds boiled
and rolled forward like a wave just above the terrain, swallowing the
red glow of the sunrise and spewing back out fire and smoke. The

318

wave drew nearer. Elric winced. It’s like standing before an entire ocean
of evil—a tidal wave of malevolence about to crush us. What is the King
going to do? How is He going to deliver us from that? He braced his feet,
gritted his teeth, and lifted his chin toward the high wall of blackness
approaching.
The wave reached the outer edge of the camp. The roar of
thousands of demon wings rose like the crashing of a mighty ocean
wave. The front of the wave began to split.
Timrok called out, “What’s that? What’s happening?”
The wall separated as though a giant invisible wedge split the flood
just before it reached the camp. The sides passed around the camp,
and the wave wrapped back together again, closing them in from
the back side. Elric stared at the panorama surrounding them with
his mouth wide open. On every side flew hundreds of demons with
twisted faces and raging eyes, caught up in the furious momentum
southward. Their bat-like wings beat the air of the Middle Realm,
and they jostled for flying space. They don’t see us . . . or the camp.
They didn’t even seem to notice that they had diverted around it.
Elric glanced straight up—clear blue sky. The wave glowed red on the
inside from the crimson lightning, and boiling fire flashed between
the beaelzurim. High walls of smoldering redness engulfed the camp
all around.
Zaben said, “The Lord is parting this . . . this . . . Red Sea.”
Elric never took his eyes off the wall of evil streaming by them.
“Yes. Yes, He is.”
The camp remained in the midst of the sea of demon warriors—
untouched, unmoved, and unnoticed—for several long minutes.
Finally, the last of the wave closed around the back side of the camp

and faded away over the southern horizon. The sky became quiet. The
entire troop of elzurim sighed and looked around at each other with
nervous smiles. Timrok and Zaben nodded to their teams without a
word, and the warriors dispersed and disappeared to their posts.
“That was amazing,” Zaben said. “Why can’t it always be that
easy?”
“What would be the challenge of that?” Timrok said.
The three laughed.
“It does make our work more interesting,” Elric said. He checked
the humans. Still sleeping. They will never know what had just happened.
Zaben nodded. “The Lord likes variety. Every adventure is a new
one. Every mystery unfolds in a new way.”
“I like it,” Elric said.
“As do I,” said Timrok.
“You were right about the significance of this day,” Elric said. He
paused. “However, even knowing that something might be coming—I
don’t think we were supposed to be prepared for what just happened.”
“This whole mission is shrouded in mystery,” Zaben said.

donkey with the reins in one hand.

Joseph called forward to Mary, “Are you sure

that’s it?”

Mary turned her head back toward Joseph without missing a
stride. “Yes, that’s definitely the place.”
“I can’t believe you were able to find it.”
“I told you I would be able to recognize it if we passed close
enough.” Mary stopped and waited for Joseph to catch up. “You were

the one who brought us to the right region in Judea. How did you
know how to get here?”
Joseph shrugged. They continued walking.
“You must have been led by the Lord,” she said.
“I suppose. I never heard any leading. I just followed the trail
and went in the direction that felt right.”
“Here we are,” Mary said.
“You get Jesus,” Joseph said, “and I’ll tie up the donkey.”
They stepped up to the weathered wooden door of the small
house and paused long enough to look at each other with anxious
smiles. Joseph knocked. The door cracked open and a pair of eyes
peered out. The eyes stopped on Mary. Then the door flung open.
“Mary! What a surprise!” There stood Zacharias with a huge,
stunned smile erupting through his gray beard.
“And this must be Joseph. It is so good to meet you. And this,”
he said, lingering for a second on Jesus, “must be . . . ” He lingered
another second. “Oh, good heavens, come in! Come in! Elizabeth—
look who’s here!”

Tumur watched the surprise visitors disappear inside Zacharias’s
house. The elzur captain who arrived with them remained outside
and scanned the area. Tumur ducked low and couldn’t make out the
face of the captain. After a short delay, the captain went inside, and
Tumur breathed out a long stream of smoke.
Very interesting. That was Mary from Nazareth—with a husband
and child.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

322

He searched the local horizon for his old partner, Luchek.
Nothing. Wisping like silent fog, Tumur moved around to all his
normal hiding spots. He didn’t find Luchek anywhere.
How long ago did Luchek leave with Mary? Three years? He must
have discovered that Mary—and her child—are not the ones we seek. It
is the only explanation.
He dragged his upper lip back and forth across his stray, upward–
pointing fang.
The boy looked very ordinary. There was no sign of divinity there.
Still, why would they require a captain as an escort?
He peered at the outside of the house.
I shall have to watch these visitors closely.
***
Inside Zacharias’s house, Elric and Lacidar stood just inside the
door.
“I have been interested to see John’s reaction to Jesus,” Elric said
to Lacidar. “What will the anointing of the Holy Spirit on a three–
year–old look like when he sees the King?”
Lacidar laughed. “There’s your answer.”
John’s eyes stayed fixed on Jesus. The adults talked, and John hid
behind Elizabeth—without ever breaking his gaze.
“He knows something is different about Jesus,” Elric said, “but
he’s too young to understand.”
Jesus bounded around the room until He found some of John’s
toys on the floor. John peeked from behind Elizabeth. Jesus flopped
down onto the floor and grabbed a toy. John ran over and held out

323

his hand for his toy without saying a word. Jesus laughed and handed
it to him. Jesus played with another toy, and John held out his hand
for that one. Jesus laughed and handed it to John as though it was
a game. Jesus jumped up and ran to Mary, who held His blanket.
Snatching the blanket, He giggled all the way to the corner of the
room where He squatted down and hid under the blanket.
The adult conversation stopped.
“Watch this,” Mary whispered to Zacharias and Elizabeth. “This
is His favorite game.” She raised her voice. “Where did Jesus go? I’m
looking everywhere. I know He has to be—”
“Over here!” John shouted. He rushed across the room and flung
the blanket off Jesus. “Here He is!”
Jesus sprang from His spot and ran as fast as His little legs
could go. John stayed right behind Him, squealing and laughing.
They completed three laps around the room. Jesus plopped down
and covered Himself with the blanket. Before anyone could wonder
where Jesus had gone, John hopped up and down and ran circles
around Jesus. “Here He is! Here He is!” John ripped the blanket off
Jesus again, pointed, hopped, and laughed.
“I don’t think John understands the game,” Elizabeth said.
Everyone laughed.
Elric and Lacidar smiled at each other and nodded.
After they finished supper and got the boys to sleep, the parents
gathered in the quiet of the lamplight.
“Where to from here?” Zacharias asked.
“We don’t know,” Joseph said. “We will probably try Bethlehem
or Jerusalem. I feel like we should be in Jerusalem near the temple.
But the last time we tried to settle in Jerusalem, it seemed like all the

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

324

doors kept closing for us and we ended up back in Bethlehem. I think
we will probably start with Jerusalem again and see what happens.”
Elizabeth shot Zacharias a concerned look.
“What? What is it?” Mary asked.
“Remember how ruthless Herod was?” Zacharias said. “His son
Archelaus is ruling over Judea now, and it looks like he is going to be
as bad, or worse, than Herod. He has killed thousands already.”
“Tell them about Simon,” Elizabeth said.
“There was a man named Simon, of Peraea, who once was a slave
of King Herod. While everything was in disorder, he claimed himself
king.”
“He had many supporters,” Elizabeth said.
“He actually claimed he would be Israel’s messiah. He burned
down Herod’s palace at Jericho and plundered it. He also destroyed
many other of the king’s houses with fire and plundered them.
Eventually, Gratus, the commander of Herod’s infantry—”
“The army that used to support Herod now supports Archelaus,”
Elizabeth said.
Zacharias nodded. “Gratus and the Roman army completely
destroyed all of Simon’s fighters. Simon escaped at first, but Gratus
caught him and cut off his head. This was a significant uprising, but
anyone who even speaks out against Archelaus has seen a similar fate.”
“He is an evil tyrant,” Elizabeth said. “I fear for our own safety
even out here. If I were you, I would try to stay as far away from him
as possible.”
“But where can we go?” Joseph asked. “How much of the region
is under his control?” His eyes filled with dread.

HOME GROUND

325

Zacharias scrunched up his old wrinkled face, “He only has
Judea and Samaria.”
“Only?”
“It could be worse. Fortunately, Archelaus does not have control
over all of Israel as Herod did. Antipas is tetrarch over Galilee and
the east bank of the Jordan, and Philip is tetrarch over Ituraea and
Trachonitis. They both seem to be better than Archelaus. Perhaps
you could return to Galilee? That was your old home before all this
started.”
Joseph shrugged his shoulders. “Yes, but I have no family left
there and Mary’s family is a little distant ever since the pregnancy.
And it’s too far from the temple in Jerusalem. Should we not be close
to the temple so He can be trained by the best teachers in the land?”
Zacharias tucked his chin down into his beard and looked
up at Joseph through his bushy eyebrows. “Don’t make too many
assumptions about the spiritual leaders in the temple.”
“Even so, it just makes the most sense. And, if that is where
the Lord wants us, should we not trust Him to protect us from
Archelaus—or whoever is in power?”
The debate over where to go continued for a while longer before
everybody became too sleepy to continue. They prepared for bed, and
Zacharias led them in a prayer for guidance and clear direction from
the Lord.
Before Zacharias finished his prayer, Grigor slipped through the
ceiling and alighted in front of Elric. His wings folded into his back
without a sound.
“A word of the Lord,” Grigor said.
“Yes?” Elric replied.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

326

“The Lord has heard the prayer of Zacharias and wants you to
deliver His answer to Joseph tonight. Speak to him in a dream and
tell him not to go up to Jerusalem. He is to settle in the region of
Galilee—Nazareth, his hometown.”
“In His service,” Elric said.
Grigor paused a moment and looked Elric and Lacidar in the
eyes. His eyes had a twinkle that seemed to say, “I know things from
the throne, and I know what you are going through.” He shared a
look of common purpose, common brotherhood.
“By His word,” Grigor said. He unfurled his silent wings and
with a single burst disappeared.
Elric’s attention returned to the humans in the room.
“Fear not,” Zacharias said. “The Lord will make His will known
to you somehow. Simply trust and do not be anxious. Get a good
night’s sleep. We shall talk more tomorrow.”
***
Joseph walked through a dense green garden along a quaint path
under a happy springtime sun. Scores of wildflowers bloomed red,
yellow, and purple. Birds twittered. Spotted butterflies danced on a
cool breeze. Everything brimmed with life and hope and expectation.
Ahead in the distance, Jerusalem stood high on a hill, shining like
polished gold in the sun. Surrounded by so much life and beauty,
he skipped down the path toward the glowing city on the hill. His
movements flowed like an effortless song, and he almost felt as though
he floated along with the butterflies.

HOME GROUND

327

As his journey continued, the lushness of the garden drew thin.
Flowers and trees became fewer and fewer until all the plants were
simple shrubs. The butterflies disappeared, and the birds became
scarce. He still pressed forward, but his steps became labored, and he
had to fight for his breath. Farther down the trail brought even less
vegetation. He trudged onward and soon found himself in a desolate
wasteland. Visible waves of heat rose from the lifeless sand, and a
single vulture circled overhead. I have to get to Jerusalem. But it’s getting
so hard. He looked up to the hill for inspiration. The appearance of
the city had changed. Now it looked pale and dark gray, hiding under
the shadow of gloomy black clouds.
Joseph stopped and looked around. Nothing but flat, lifeless
desert in every direction. Fear and despair wrapped themselves
around Joseph like a snake and stole his breath. What’s that up ahead?
Just before the edge of the horizon, a large boulder jutted out of the
sand. Is that a man sitting on top of the boulder? He scanned the endless
desert. There’s nothing here but that. I suppose I should go investigate. He
drudged through the sand for a long time, every laborious step taxing
his strength and will. He drew nearer to the boulder, and it became
clearer that a man did indeed sit atop it. Joseph approached the man.
I’ve seen this man before.
“Hello, Joseph,” the man said with a pleasant smile.
“I know you,” Joseph said with panting breath. “You’re the angel
who appeared to me before.”
The angel smiled.
“What is going on?” Joseph asked. “Where am I?”
“The more important question is ‘where are you going?’”
“I am going to Jerusalem.”

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

328

“Why?”
“I . . . I don’t know.”
“Do not go up to Jerusalem. There is nothing but death awaiting
you there. Return to your home country of Galilee. Go to Nazareth.
This is the word of the Lord for you.”
Joseph turned and looked up at the hill toward Jerusalem.
Nothing but a black cloud remained. He turned back, and the angel
had disappeared. Joseph felt very alone, surrounded by endless desert
everywhere. The sand spun around him in a whirlwind. He closed his
eyes, and panic swirled through his mind.
Joseph woke up. He strained his eyes into the darkness. Mary
and Jesus slept. Joseph gave Mary a nudge.
“Mary, wake up. I had another dream.”
***
Two weeks later, Zacharias tore a bite–sized piece of bread,
dabbed it into the olive oil, and popped it into his mouth. Between
chews he said, “This has been the most excellent two weeks of my life.
Are you sure you must leave now?”
Joseph nodded. “It is time. You have been more than gracious
to let us stay with you, but we have clear direction from the Lord.”
“Yes, I know.” Zacharias rubbed his forehead. “It is for selfish
reasons, I’m sure, that I desire you to stay. This last year has been . . .
difficult. I have been facing mounting friction from the other
priests ever since the birth of John. I admit, I may have been overly
enthusiastic retelling John’s miraculous birth. But it seems like there
is something deeper feeding their hostility toward me. And lately,

it’s difficult to execute my normal duties without strong resistance
and animosity. But this time with you, with Jesus, has helped me
see again what I know in my heart to be true—that our son, John,
is the prophet who will go before the Messiah. And the Messiah, the
Promised One, is here.”
Zacharias watched Jesus playing on the floor. He shook his head.
“This little one will someday conquer Rome and establish His
kingdom forever. What I would give to be a part of His army that
finally vanquishes Israel’s enemies and ushers in a new era of peace
and joy on the earth.” Zacharias sighed. “Do you think we will see
you again?”
“I don’t know,” Joseph said. “Perhaps during a Passover festival
in Jerusalem?”
“Perhaps.”

he morning sun crept up behind low puffy clouds and gave the
Nazarene marketplace a warm orange glow. Elric stood beside a
busy produce stand with rows of wooden boxes holding mounds

of colorful fruits and vegetables. His hand rested on Joseph’s shoulder
as Joseph looked over the produce. Elric scanned across the street over
the heads of a dozen milling patrons. Jenli emerged from around the
corner. There he is. Their eyes met, and Elric nodded once. Jenli smiled,
bent down, and spoke something to the man walking beside him. The
man paused a moment, then turned left toward the produce stand where
Elric stood.

Joseph placed a handful of figs into his small basket.
“Joseph! Joseph, is that you?” the approaching man called out.
Joseph turned his head. It was the man who had bought his
family house and property after the man’s horse died while under his
care. Joseph swallowed hard and gave an awkward smile.
“Right on time,” Elric said to Jenli.
Jenli smiled and rubbed the stubble on the back of his head.
“It’s great to see you,” the man said to Joseph. “You are the last
person I would have expected to happen upon today.”
“Yes, it is quite a coincidence,” Joseph answered, shuffling his
feet.
“How are you? Is Mary well?”
“Yes, we are doing very well. Mary is back at the inn with our
three–year–old boy. I just came to the market to pick up a few things.”
Joseph kept looking down at his basket and avoiding eye contact.
“Oh, yes,” the man said, “I remember—her days were almost
complete when you left here. That was a most unfortunate situation
for you, wasn’t it? I have labored under deep regret every day since
you left.”
“Be at peace. It was difficult time, but things have worked out
for the best.”
“What brings you back to Nazareth? Are you moving back or
just passing through?”
“We’re not sure. I need to stay in Galilee, probably Nazareth. We
will need to find work and place to live.”
“That’s wonderful!” The man pulled Joseph aside out of the
jostling of the produce stand customers.

332

“This is an amazing coincidence,” the man said in a more close–up
voice. “I have been trying to sell your old place for almost a year now.
How would you like to buy it back? I will make you a good deal.”
Joseph’s eyebrows raised.
The man continued. “Ever since you left, I have tried to figure
out what to do with the place. I don’t need the house myself, but
I can’t let it sit empty. I rented it out a few times, but each time
the tenants had to leave for one reason or another. I couldn’t keep it
rented. Eventually, I decided I needed to sell it. Unfortunately, every
buyer has backed out at the final moment. I have lowered the price
three times, and still it has not sold.”
“Interesting,” Joseph said.
Elric smirked and glanced over at Jenli, who pursed his lips and
raised his eyebrows.
The man said to Joseph, “I would be willing to sell it to you
today for half the current value of the property.”
“Half?” Joseph’s voice cracked.
“This was your family’s property. My soul could have peace again
if you took it back.”
“This is an amazing offer.”
Elric and Jenli watched the men work out the details. “Very nice
work,” Elric said to Jenli. “All the pieces came together today exactly
as planned.”
“Thank you, Captain. Does Joseph have enough money to
purchase the house?”
“Oh, yes. He still has most of the gold left. He can easily pay the
entire amount and have a sizable reserve. Is there work for him here
in Nazareth?”

“We have four jobs already arranged. He has enough work to

“Excellent. We will be able to settle here for a long time.”

Mary waved to Joseph from the front door of his old family
house as he wheeled his handcart full of tools down the path. He
squinted against the rising sun on his face and pushed the cart past
their garden. The young garden stalks stood full and green, and the
vines spread thick and deep. They had planted late, but Mary remained
hopeful they would still see a fall harvest. She watched Joseph another
minute more and turned back into the house with a satisfied smile.
After only three months back in Nazareth, life had already
taken on a comfortable rhythm. She pictured Joseph returning home
tonight, sweaty and tired from a hard day’s work. She thought about
supper, but a fleeting image of her father and mother interrupted her
and tied her stomach in a knot. Her family had been accommodating
about their return, but they obviously still carried the family shame
of her situation. She wondered how long they would remain distant.
She took a deep breath and tried to remember all they had been
through so far. It amazed her how easily all the details of the move
back to Nazareth fell into place. She closed her eyes and wondered
what would come next.
Just then, a noise from the other room caught her attention. She
knew what that meant. The first part of their daily routine consisted
of morning prayer time, and once again, Jesus must have woken

up and started without her. She turned the corner and found Him
already on His knees. A rambunctious three-year-old, eager to spend
time in prayer—Mary shook her head and smiled. She knelt down
beside her young Son and joined the conversation already in progress.
***
Elric watched from the corner of the room as Mary and Jesus
prayed. I love watching words spoken in the flesh enter the Middle Realm
to do their work. Some words turned to light and rested back on their
spirits and their house. Some shot outward like arrows toward faraway
marks. Some rose like fragrant incense upward through the spiritual
air, through the roof, spiraling heavenward. Every word full of energy,
full of purpose.
At the same time, warm shafts of light rode back down the waves
of energy toward Mary and Jesus. The King was speaking. He was
always speaking. The words hit Mary—like water on dark, well–
waxed glass. A tiny shadow of the rays penetrated the surface of her
spirit, but most of it beaded up and rolled off. Elric shook his head.
She can’t hear. None can. Ever since the Fall. If only there was a way
to make a man’s spirit alive again . . .
The words also hit Jesus. Every word from the Throne penetrated
the Son and didn’t escape. His spirit was alive, and other than the lack
of visible face–to–face contact, no barrier existed between Him and the
Father. He only had the understanding of a human three-year-old, so
the conversation with the Father sounded simple, but it was very real.
This is how it is supposed to be.

Prayer time finished. Still on their knees, Mary put her arm
around Jesus’ shoulders.
“You know, God likes it when we talk to Him. He always hears
our prayers,” Mary said.
“Mm-hm, I know,” Jesus replied in His childish little voice.
The matter–of–fact tone in His reply struck Mary off guard. She
believed it, but in reality most of time she felt like her prayers just
bounced off the ceiling. Sometimes she thought she could sense the
Lord’s presence, but usually she even wondered about that. She sat up
and stroked Jesus’ back.
“So, does He answer you?” Mary asked.
“Oh, yes, He talks to me all the time.”
“You hear His voice?”
“Not in my ears. I just know what He says in here,” He said,
rubbing His chest with His little hands.
“What does He say?”
“He says He loves me.”
“That is right, honey. The Lord does love you. He loves all of us.
What else does he tell you?”
“He says He is my abba. Isn’t Abba my abba?”
Mary cleared her throat and rubbed her forehead.
“Well, dear . . . the Lord is the Father of everything because He
created everything. He is our Father in heaven.”
Jesus smiled and nodded.
Mary looked around the room and pulled a stray strand of hair
back behind her ear.
“Does He . . . tell you anything else?”
Jesus paused and fidgeted. “He told me you have a baby in your
tummy. Where is the baby, Ima? I don’t see him.”

Mary went flush.
She was a few weeks late and had been feeling a little off, so she
suspected she might be pregnant. But there was no way Jesus could
have known anything. She hadn’t told Joseph yet. She wasn’t even sure
about it herself—until now. The unexpected confirmation washed
over her like a flood. She laughed, and a stream of tears overflowed
her eyes and ran down her cheeks.
She wiped her eyes and answered, “Well, you can’t see him yet,
honey. But I guess he is in there.” Her voice cracked. “He will grow
and grow, and Ima’s tummy will get very big, and eventually he will
come out. Then we will get to hold him—or her. It could be a boy
or a girl.”
“I think it’s a boy,” Jesus said.
“Oh, you do?” Mary laughed. “Then I guess you are going to
have a little brother!” She couldn’t stop the tears.
Jesus looked confused by Mary’s flood of emotions, and He got
up and wrapped His little arms as far around Mary as He could reach
and patted her on the back.
“It’s all right, Ima. It will be all right.”
Mary laughed and cried even harder. “I know. Ima is very happy
and very excited.”
She hugged Him back, and they got up and danced around the
room.

late autumn breeze carried a crisp chill across Nazareth.
Behind the warmth of the walls of their home, Daniel poked
at the wood in the fireplace while Ruth pulled coins from a

small wooden box. Vorsogh stood beside Daniel, whispering toxic drops
of despair into his spirit.

“Daniel,” Ruth said. “Daniel, look at me.”
Daniel turned his head and gazed in the direction of Ruth with
vacant, glassy eyes.
“I need you to go to town and buy some fresh fruit. Can you do
that for me? Daniel?”
337

Daniel got up and reached for his cloak.
“Good,” Ruth said. She dropped the coins into a small leather
pouch and held it out for Daniel. “Go straight to the marketplace and
come right back home. Do you understand?”
Daniel took the money pouch, turned, and walked out the door
with one slow, miserable motion. Vorsogh walked along.
Just outside of town, a lone tent sat beside the trail. In the
Middle Realm, it stood like a mighty stone fortress—dark, cold,
and sinister. Vorsogh snorted a puff of yellow smoke. Excellent.
He chuckled and flew ahead to the tent. A woman, full of a
beaelzur spirit, stood outside the tent, calling to people passing
by.
Vorsogh alighted in front of her and said to the demon within,
“I have a charge that is ready. I will bring him to you if you will open
him up to me.”
A small ashen spirit, half the size of Vorsogh, stepped out of
the woman. He had smooth skin and a hairless, round head. “Step
inside,” the spirit said with a soft and airy voice.
Inside the tent, no less than twenty demons filled the space.
Some stood along the walls. Some swirled through the murky smoke
in mid-air. Some clung to the ceiling and watched from above with
menacing red eyes.
“Tell me about him,” the spirit said.
“The boy’s name is Daniel. He is twelve. I killed his brother two
years ago, and I now have this young one lost in despair. We could
‘reunite’ him with his brother.”
“His brother’s name?”

“Levi.”
“Bring him in.”

Near the edge of town Daniel came across a large tent beside the
road. It looked to be the tent of some nomad or group of nomads,
and a woman stood in front of the open flap of the tent. The woman
called out to all the passersby.
“Fortunes told! Come in and let me tell you your future.”
Daniel passed close enough to see the woman’s face. She looked
dirty and trail-worn, and her eyes unnerved him; but her voice
sounded smooth and compelling. Daniel gave a humph. I have no
future. He passed by without giving her any more notice.
He walked a stone’s–throw distance and heard over his shoulder,
“So much sadness for one so young.”
Daniel kept walking.
“Daniel! Do you miss your brother?” The woman’s voice sounded
compassionate but mysterious.
Daniel stopped cold. Chills shot up and down his spine, and the
hair on the back of his neck stood up straight. He turned around and
eyed the woman. “How do you know my name? And how do you
know about my brother?”
“I know . . . many things,” the woman said.
Daniel approached with small cautious steps. Something deep in
the pit of his being told him this woman was dangerous, but his head
spun with wild thoughts, excitement, and emotions that he hadn’t
experienced in a very long time.

340

Daniel continued forward. “Do you know my brother?”
The woman replied with a soft and mysterious voice, “Not in
life.”
“Who are you?” Daniel asked.
“I am . . . an intermediary. A bridge between this world and the
next.”
“You talk to spirits?”
“Yes,” she replied with a teasing smile.
“And do they talk to you?”
“Yes.” Her eyebrows raised high, and her eyes looked like pools
of deep wisdom.
“So, it is possible,” Daniel said. He paused. The woman’s gaze
felt like it could see right into his soul. “Would it be possible to talk
with my brother? I mean, for me? Can you help me talk with my
brother?”
“Perhaps.” She turned her chin and looked away with a coy
coolness. “There is a price. Do you have any money?”
Daniel pulled out the leather pouch. The coins clinked into his
hand out of the pouch.
The woman smiled. “That will do,” she said, holding out her
hand.
Daniel turned his hand over and let the coins drop into the
woman’s open palm. She smiled again and took him by the hand.
“Come inside.”
The inside of the tent had a dark and secretive atmosphere. A
single table sat poised in the center of the room with several chairs
stationed around it. Three drippy candles atop human skulls on
the weathered wooden table provided the only light and cast eerie

dancing shadows on the walls and cluttered shelves. The shelves were
filled with many small beakers and bottles of mysterious powders
and liquids. A heavy layer of smoke from incense hung low from the
murky ceiling. The air felt thick and difficult to breathe, and Daniel
had to fight back the oppressive fear crushing him. His skin turned
cold and clammy. This place hides a dangerous unseen presence. I should
go. This is too scary. No! I’ve always wondered about talking with spirits.
Now I might actually have a chance to talk with my brother.
“What do we do now?” he asked.
The woman closed the flap of the tent. “Just relax,” she answered
with a cool and controlled tone. “Please, have a seat.” She pulled
out a chair for him. “Very good.” She sat down across from him and
reached across the table. “Now, take my hands.”
Her cold, dry hands gave Daniel a sharp chill. She closed her
eyes, raised her chin, and cocked her head as though listening to some
voice that only she could hear.
“Your brother’s name was Levi. Am I right?”
“Yes! Yes! That’s right! Can you—”
“Shhh. We need to be very still and quiet. Close your eyes and
clear your mind. The spirits cannot be rushed or coerced. Open
yourself up to them and they will speak. Relax. Relax. Very good.”
For several minutes they sat with their eyes closed in the flickering
candlelight. In the deathly quiet, Daniel’s heart pounded all the way
up in his throat. He kept repeating in his mind, Come in, come in,
please come in.
Finally, the woman breathed an ominous whisper, “He is here.”
Daniel squeezed her hands and waited.
“Daniel, Levi is here, and he wants me to give you a message.”

342

“Yes, what is it?”
“He says he misses being with you.”
“I miss him, too! Can you tell him I miss him?”
“He says he knows you do.”
“Can you ask him if he will talk to me directly?”
The woman opened her eyes with a wild intensity. Daniel’s
stomach leapt into his throat. He swallowed and shifted in his seat.
“Be careful of what you ask. Are you sure that is what you want?”
Daniel hesitated for just a second, swallowed again and answered,
“Yes, yes, I am sure.”
The woman closed her eyes and became still. She twitched. The
twitch turned into mild trembling . . . restrained shuddering . . .
violent shaking . . . horrifying convulsions. Daniel pressed hard
against the back of his chair, his eyes wide and his jaw slack.
She stopped. Her head slumped down. She looked dead.
Daniel took a deep breath. The air filled his lungs with a
blistering fire—and an unmistakable sense that he was not alone,
like the hollow shell of his meaningless existence had somehow been
filled. He grabbed his chest and fought for another breath.
“Daniel,” a voice said.
He glanced at the woman across the table. Still no signs of life.
“Daniel.”
Daniel rubbed his deaf ear. Was that his brother’s voice . . . in
his deaf ear?
“Levi? Is that you?” Daniel said, turning his ear upward.
“Yes, Daniel, it is me, Levi.”
“I can hear you! I can hear you! I knew it was true. And you can
hear me?”

“Yes. Why have you called me?”
“I missed you and wanted to talk with you again. Can you see
me?”
“Yes, of course.”
“But I can’t see you. Why can’t I see you?”
“It is a difficult thing for the living to see into my world. Very
few are able.”
“But it is possible, isn’t it? I have seen spirits before. Can you
make yourself visible to me?”
“I will try,” the voice said, “but remember, most people are not
able to see into the spiritual realm.”
“I will be able. I’m ready. I want to see you!”
He waited. Nothing. He squinted into the darkness. Still
nothing. He strained against hope, against fear, against his feeble
flesh, against . . . There! The faint outline of a person appeared in front
of him in the shadows. Gradually, the outline filled in until the full
figure of a young man became clear. It looked like Levi with the same
clothes he wore when he was killed. Not actual flesh and bone—but
transparent with the color of a ghostly gray mist.
“I can see you! I truly can!”
“That is very good, little brother. Tell me, what is it you would
like to know?”
It’s a dream come true! Quick . . . a question worthy of this special
moment. “What is it like? Are there spirits everywhere around us like
I thought?”
“Yes, just like you thought. And it is very peaceful here.”
“So, have you seen God?”

The spirit smiled a knowing, concerned smile and answered,
“Daniel, there is no God. After you die, your spirit just stays here on
earth and joins all the others.”
“What do you and all the spirits do?”
“We help people and guide them and bring them comfort in
times of need.”
“What about angels? Have you seen any angels?”
“No, of course not, they are nothing more than the souls of men
who have gone on before.”
“I miss you,” Daniel said. “I miss these talks. Is there any way
you can stay with me all the time and be my guide?”
“Yes, I will stay with you. I promise. You will not always be able
to see me, but I will speak to you. You can always believe in me.”
The image faded away into the shadows.
“Wait!” Daniel called out. “Don’t go!”
“I am still here.”
Daniel tapped his deaf ear. Still dead except for the sound of
Levi’s voice.
The voice said, “I told you I would always be with you.”
Without warning, the woman’s head sprang back upright. She
looked stunned and disoriented. She stared at Daniel for several
moments and scanned the room.
“You heard from your brother?” she asked.
“Better than that—I actually saw him!”
“That is good. That is very good.” She stood up and shuffled
over behind Daniel’s chair. She pulled the chair backward and said,
“Thank you for coming in today. I am always happy to reunite family
with their beloved. I trust your experience was rich and fulfilling.”

Without another word, she ushered him out of the tent and bid

Vorsogh stepped from the tent into the sunlight, looking at the
world through Daniel’s eyes. Ahhh, yes. It feels so good to be wrapped
in human skin. The coolness of the autumn breeze prickled against
Daniel’s face.
His face. His body. His direct connection with the Physical
Realm.
The power he now commanded over this pathetic human made
Vorsogh feel heady and godlike.
“Come, little brother,” Vorsogh said, “let’s go to the market for

“But I just spent all the money Mother gave me.”
“Worry not. Just trust me.”

A

festive ceremony filled Joseph and Mary’s home with many
people and many smiles on the eighth day after the birth
of Jesus’ brother. Elric stood with Zaben, Timrok, and Jenli

against the wall and watched the ceremony while their teams kept a safe
perimeter outside. The crowd became quiet. The honored Mohel, Raziel,
recited the Brit Milah blessing.

“Our God and God of our fathers, preserve this child for his
father and mother, and his name in Israel shall be called James, the
son of . . . ” Raziel stopped and smiled at Joseph.

The memory of this very moment during Jesus’ Brit Milah
welled up within Elric. During that ceremony, Raziel acknowledged
Jesus’ true father. No other person in the room besides Raziel, Joseph, and
Mary, knows the significance of this particular moment. Elric suppressed
a laugh and dabbed the corner of one eye with his finger. Jenli smirked
at Elric with raised eyebrows. Elric tightened his lower lip, raised his
chin, and stared at Raziel.
Looking Joseph right in the eyes, Raziel continued. “Joseph.
May the father rejoice in his offspring, and his mother be glad with
the fruit of her womb, as it is written: ‘May your father and mother
rejoice, and she who bore you be glad.’”
After the official ceremony completed, the real festivities began.
People laughed and ate and milled about. The children all ran out
of the house for the freedom of outdoor play. Jesus ran right in the
middle of the small pack.
Elric and the three lieutenants stepped outside with the children.
Elric made a quick scan. Two of Timrok’s team are within close striking
distance. The other three are concealed and close. In the mid-range
distance—there, there, and there—Zaben and Jenli’s teams are in place.
The perimeter around the King looks secure.
“I do enjoy watching the children play,” Timrok said.
“Mmm,” Elric replied, still scanning the area.
“I see Jesus is wearing a new tunic cut from your cloak material,”
Jenli said. “Was Mary surprised when the Lord restored the material
to its original size again?”
“I don’t think so,” Elric said. “She appears to recognize the
importance of this covering, even though she does not know its true
purpose. And she has the faith to believe this provision will continue.”

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

The girls played in the shade of the house and took turns
decorating each other’s hair with fresh–picked flowers. The boys
chased each other with sticks and fought epic sword battles amid a
cloud of dust.
Elric watched a stick–sword fight and smiled. “Jesus looks like
every other young boy in the street—with no indicators of who He
is. Joseph has a very normal looking family, especially now that there
is an additional sibling.”
“For two years we have remained hidden in Nazareth,” Timrok
said, “with not a single unsafe encounter with the enemy. Do they no
longer seek Him?”
Elric stared across the horizon. “They still seek.”
Zaben bit his lip and joined Elric’s gaze across the horizon.
“Their strategy has changed. They know the King cannot be touched,
except through the hands of man. I perceive a three–layered plan in
action.” He paused. Jenli and Timrok turned and waited. “First, they
raise up false messiahs to lead armed revolts.”
Elric nodded. “Simon of Peraea.”
“War causes much destruction,” Zaben continued. “The enemy
knows it is possible the King could be swept away in the heat of an
insurrection. Unrest is high across the nation. The people are looking
for a messiah. The enemy is raising up leaders.”
“Are there any of note right now?” Elric asked.
Jenli pulled his ledger from inside his tunic and flipped through
it. “There is a shepherd named Athronges and his four brothers.
Athronges has already declared himself messiah and makes war
against Archelaus. His brothers each command sizeable armies. They
are brutal, murderous men.”

349

“If we are not careful, the King could be caught in the middle of
someone else’s battle,” Elric said.
“Eventually each of the false messiahs will be destroyed,” Zaben
said. “The enemy will raise them up, then crush them at the hands of
the Romans. This leads to the second layer of their plan. After years
of devastating losses, the people will lose heart.”
Elric crossed his arms and nodded. “So, by the time the King is
ready to begin His campaign, the people will not have courage left
to support Him.” He raised his chin. “And the third layer of their
strategy?”
“Physical oppression,” Zaben said. “Sickness, disease, leprosy,
demon possession. All these are increasing in the land. Those that
the King would call upon for His armies will be too weak and lame
to serve.”
“There was another possession right here in Nazareth a few
months ago,” Jenli said. “A young boy. The son of a shepherd.”
Timrok put his hands on the handles of his swords. “The enemy
can cripple the entire nation. All we need is the King and ten good
men. We have seen deliverance with less.”
“Timrok is right,” Elric said. “But, still, we must be mindful of
the enemy’s tactics.”
Around the side of the house, Jesus had been cornered by three
other boys—sticks drawn and ready to strike. Just as they moved in,
Jesus swatted two of their sticks aside with His stick and ducked out
through the middle of them, laughing as He ran.
“How long?” Zaben said. “How long until the King begins His
campaign? Have you received any word yet?”
Elric looked upward into a blank sky. “Nothing.”

They all watched the boys play for several minutes without a
sound.
“We should be doing something,” Zaben said.
“What?” asked Timrok. “We proceed only at the word of the
King.”
Zaben chewed on his lip and scowled. “Preparing. The King
expects us to prepare.”
Timrok crossed his arms. “Preparing what?”
Zaben paused and looked down at his feet.
“Jesus,” Jenli said. “We help prepare Jesus. He is only four and
a half, but I think he is ready for formal education at the hand of a
human mentor.”
“Yes,” Zaben said.
“Do we have such a mentor?” Timrok asked.
Elric nodded. “Raziel. He is our man.”
All three lieutenants nodded.
“I agree,” Elric said. “Jesus is receiving great wisdom from the
Holy Spirit, but He still needs the training of men. The sooner we
begin, the better. Zaben, begin speaking to Raziel.”
Zaben smiled. “In His service.”

oseph led his donkey cart up to the crowd gathered at the edge
of Nazareth. Mary swayed with the rhythm of the rocky trail
in the back of the cart with James in her arms. Five–year–

old Jesus hung His arms over the side rails and laughed and waved at
everyone. Two weeks’ worth of provisions were stacked high in the cart,
including a large tent, wrapped in a tight bundle.

Elric walked beside Joseph with Timrok at the rear. They stopped,
and Zaben and Jenli approached from out of the crowd.
Elric glanced at the sliver of sun just peeking over the horizon.
“Is the caravan ready?”
351

“Almost,” Jenli said. “There are three more families to come.
Then the full group will be assembled.”
“Very good,” Elric said. “You two keep your teams hidden.
Zaben, your team will guard the front and rear. Jenli, your team will
cover our side flanks. Timrok.”
Timrok stepped up from behind, scanning left, then right.
“Disperse your team among the caravan, but you stay close to
me. Remember, there will be enemy warriors traveling with us.” He
looked Timrok in the eyes. “Keep your distance, and do not engage
unless the King is threatened.”
Timrok nodded.
“This trip is an important test for us,” Elric said. “We will have
to make this pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast every year.
I don’t have to tell you that our risk of exposure is extreme. Be on
your highest guard.”
Jenli said, “Our last time in the temple courts with the King for
His dedication nearly ended in ruin. How do we prevent the same
this time?”
Elric’s left eye twitched twice. “The King’s tunic serves well as
a veil against the enemy,” he said. “And your teams are skilled at
deflecting beaelzur warriors away. Our problem is hiding Him from
people who can perceive with their spirit.”
“Prophets,” Zaben said.
“Mainly, yes. They will speak out if they perceive Him. So, we
must deflect them away from the King so they do not see Him.”
“There are so many people in the courts, and our numbers are
few,” Jenli said.
“If a prophet sees the King, speak to him to remain silent.”

“And if he does not hear?” Timrok asked.
“A touch of dumbness should help him understand.”
The three lieutenants nodded.
A stir arose amongst the crowd of people. Wagon wheels turned,
beasts of burden snorted and neighed, and feet and hooves thumped
on the ground.
“It appears we are underway,” Elric said. “Deploy your teams.”
***
The caravan from Nazareth rumbled down the trail after the
completion of the Passover.
“This has been an excellent trip,” Elric said to Timrok, walking
alongside Joseph’s cart. “The journey to Jerusalem was easy. The week
of Passover was quiet. One full day of travel behind us. Another three
and a half days, and we will be back in Nazareth.”
Timrok glanced over at Mary, who walked beside Joseph with
James in her arms. Jesus walked just behind, His little legs taking four
steps for every one of theirs. “Joseph’s family looks just like all the rest
of the travelers,” he said.
Elric smiled and nodded. “Anonymity is a welcome traveling
companion.”
Xarjim, one of Zaben’s warriors, shot in from behind and landed
next to Elric. His wings folded into his back, and he leaned in close
to Elric. He said with a low voice, “Captain, a group of fifty rebels
under Athronges is fleeing this direction. They are pursued closely by
a full Roman cavalry unit.”

354

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“This is the last surviving band of Athronges’s rebellion,” Timrok
said. “These are desperate men.”
Elric took a deep breath. “If they reach the caravan, they may try
to mix in with the travelers and hide from the Romans.”
“And the soldiers will have no mercy on any they believe are
harboring fugitives,” Timrok said.
Christov, another one of Zaben’s warriors, streaked in from
behind.
“Captain,” Christov said.
“We already know,” Elric said. “Xarjim, you contact Zaben
in front of the caravan. Tell him to take his team and intercept
Athronges’s men. Divert them away from the caravan. Christov, find
Jenli at our left flank. His team is to intercept the Roman cavalry.
Divert them also.”
“In His service,” the two warriors said. They disappeared in a
flash.
Elric turned to Timrok. “Form a battle line with your team at
our rear. Divert the soldiers if you can. Engage all beaelzurim with
them. I will stay with the King.”
“In His service.” Timrok sped away into the mass of travelers
and disappeared.
Elric looked behind. In the distance, a cloud of dust approached.
Several miles behind that, another cloud of dust closed the distance
fast. Elric jumped up onto the back of the cart, crossed his arms, and
watched the approaching clouds. Every minute brought the clouds
closer. He looked out across the caravan, plodding along, with no
idea of the mortal danger that rushed toward them. He looked back
at the incoming band, close enough now that he could almost make
out the forms of the horses and riders.

AT THE HANDS OF MEN

355

Without warning, the front line of horses in the first group reared
up and came to a halt. The riders behind piled up into a bunch. Then,
with a burst of speed, the troop turned hard to the right and raced on.
The dust cloud of the Roman army stopped. It, too, turned
right, following the rebel troop. Elric took in a deep breath, held it,
and let it out. He looked back at the caravan, still plodding along. He
smiled and shook his head. All quiet here. They’ll never even know the
danger that . . .
Crash! The clanging of steel blades pierced the spiritual air at
the rear of the caravan. Elric spun around. Sparks shot into the air of
the Middle Realm and enemy war shouts rang out, but the skirmish
remained obscured by the human travelers. Timrok leapt into the air
high enough to be seen over the crowd and somersaulted downward
with both blades flashing. All became quiet.
A moment later, Timrok stood before Elric. “Captain, a small
contingent of beaelzurim has been subdued, but two Roman soldiers
made it through and are searching the people.”
Elric paused a moment and rubbed his chin. “Let them complete
their search. There is nothing here to find. They will be satisfied and
not return.”
The two Roman horsemen weaved their way through the moving
caravan. They paused here, doubled around there, paused at another
traveler. They approached Joseph’s location from behind. The two
riders sat high and powerful on haughty war horses which pranced
and snorted. The shine of the armor on their helmets and breastplates
had a stark contrast to the sea of earthy linen on the pilgrims. One
horseman trotted up beside Joseph and used the tip of his blade to
pull back Joseph’s tunic hood, exposing Joseph’s face.

356

Elric pushed the blade away and commanded, “Move along.”
The soldier eyed Joseph. He eyed Mary and the two boys. He
gave his horse a kick and trotted up to the next family.
Ten minutes later, the two horsemen galloped off in the direction
of the receding dust clouds.
Elric and Timrok walked along in silence.
Several minutes later, Raziel, the priest from Nazareth, called
out to Joseph from their left. He traveled on foot and waved his arm
at Joseph.
“Joseph, Joseph,” Raziel shouted above the noise of the hooves
and wheels. “I’ve been looking for you.”
Joseph slowed the cart and waited for Raziel to make his way
over.
“Romans,” Raziel said, joining up with Joseph.
“Yes, they are a force to be feared,” Joseph said.
“Someday. Someday the Lord will deliver us from their tyranny.”
Raziel looked back at Jesus, riding on the cart again.
“Yes,” Joseph said. “Someday.”
They walked for a while without talking.
Raziel blurted out, “You know, Jesus is a very smart little boy.”
“Yes, he seems to learn things quickly.”
“It’s more than that, He has remarkable focus, and He truly
seems to understand things.”
“M-hm,” Joseph said.
“And did you see Him in the temple? He was completely
enamored with it. It was almost like it felt like home to Him.”
“Yes, it was very cute.”
“Joseph, I have been thinking.” Raziel paused.

357

“Yes, what?”
“Well, would you be willing to let me tutor Him privately?”
“Oh, no, we could never afford that.”
“No, no, I would not ask for money.” Raziel stopped walking
and pulled Joseph aside. The rest of the troop plodded by. He spoke
low. “The more I see of Him, the more I think He might truly be
the Messiah. He is going to need a solid education, and I fear for
what might happen if He is put in with everyone else. I believe He
is going to start asking deep questions and may attract the wrong
kind of attention. He is different, and He knows it. But if I were to
teach Him privately, not only would it be safer, but I could tailor
the lessons to His ability. I think He will progress much faster than
others. I will teach Him all the Scriptures. I will teach Him Hebrew,
Greek, and Latin.”
“Our own private rabbi . . . do you not have other responsibilities
in the synagogue?”
“Yes, of course, but I know I could set aside time each day for
this. I have been praying about this for some time, and I truly believe
the Lord wants me to do this. What do you think?”
“I think it sounds . . . amazing. Are you sure?”
“Yes, yes! I am very excited about it.”
“When should we start?” Joseph asked.
Raziel put his arm around Joseph’s shoulder and began walking
again. “Let’s start right away. I think He is ready for it. I shall begin
coming to your house as soon as we get back.”
“To our house? You mean you’re not going to tutor Him in the
synagogue?”

“I think it will be safest in your home. I want Him to have a
chance to develop without attracting too much attention from either
His peers or the religious leaders. I believe He will reveal Himself
when He is ready, and until then it is our job not only to train Him
up, but to protect Him from potential outside threats while He is
young and vulnerable.”
Elric turned and smiled at Timrok. They both nodded their
heads and laughed.
Something in the distance caught Elric’s eye.
“Look,” Elric said. In the distance one large dust cloud rose into
the air. “The Romans have caught the rebels.”
“That will mark the end of the Athronges rebellion,” Timrok
said. “Death surrounds us round about.”
Elric nodded. “The sooner the King begins His campaign, the
better.”

Finally, the three commanders arrived and stood before the
throne. Marr moved his hand to the side, revealing the three
commanders from behind the ball of fire. Deep black smoke rolled
from the throne, swirled along the floor, and billowed up to their
waists.
Asherah took a step forward. “I am pleased to report that our
forces gain ground daily,” he said. “There is dissension and political
unrest in every region. Herod Archelaus is a dutiful puppet. By his
hand, we have massacred thousands. We have false messiahs gaining
followers.”
Molech interjected, “Our latest messiah, Theudas, convinced
four hundred people to follow him to the Jordan River where he
claimed he would divide the waters and lead them into a new
Promised Land. The Roman army killed many of the followers and
cut off Theudas’s head.”
Marr looked at the three without blinking.
“Sickness is on the rise, and new people are being possessed every
day,” Yarikh said. “The religious leaders’ hearts are growing harder
and more legalistic.”
Marr squeezed his hand into a fist, crushing the fireball and
sending the energy blasting through his clenched fingers in shards of
flame and crimson lightning.
“Fools!” he roared. “Where is the Child King? How hard can it
be to find One so conspicuous?” He paused, but not long enough for
them to answer. “Do you have any news from the legion in Egypt?”
“No news worthy to report,” Asherah answered.
A new fireball formed in Marr’s hand, and he stared into it
without looking up. “Continue the search. The King has to be there

find Him and destroy Him before He comes of age.”
“Shall we send more forces to Egypt?” Yarikh asked.
“No,” Marr said with a grumble. “Continue your work in Israel.
I have no confidence your legions will be able to find Him, and we
must continue to weaken the King’s people in preparation for His
coming campaign as our lord has commanded.”
The three commanders gave a slight head bow, turned, and left.

Daniel wandered through the streets of Nazareth with no
particular purpose or direction. His parents had gone to some Brit
Milah ceremony, but he had no interest. He was glad to be fourteen
and old enough to make his own choices. He drifted through the
town and side streets as though all the buildings and people were
mere shadows in another world. He had a real world elsewhere.
“Levi,” he whispered under his breath. “Are you there? Why
don’t you talk with me? I haven’t seen you since two years ago, and
you haven’t said anything all day. I can tell you’re there. I can feel your
presence.”
He shuffled down another side street, lost in thought. While
glad to have his brother with him, he noticed that Levi had become
more aggressive. The destructive suggestions Levi made sometimes
surprised him. It didn’t matter, though.
“Just don’t leave me alone again,” he said.
“I am always here,” the voice said in his right ear.

Daniel touched his otherwise deaf ear and smiled.
“I have kept our secret for a long time,” Daniel said. “When can

“Not ever,” Vorsogh said. “No one can ever know.”
“But I—”
“They won’t understand. None are enlightened as you. They
don’t even deserve to know the truth about the spirit world.”
“I suppose.”
Daniel came around the corner of a building and saw Joseph
and Mary’s house, a beehive of activity. Daniel stopped and watched
around the corner from a distance. This is where his parents had
gone—somewhere in the middle of this big party. Joseph and Mary
had had another son. They named him Joseph, but Daniel didn’t care.
He just watched and sneered at all the silly, superficial happiness.
“None of these people understand true pain and loneliness,” he
said.
The usual pack of young kids ran around and played games.
The six–and–a–half–year–old Jesus spent most of His time keeping
his two–year–old brother James corralled. Daniel watched it all with
disdain.
“I can’t even remember what it was like to have that much
ridiculous energy. They’re so naïve.”
Vorsogh spoke into Daniel’s right ear. “If one of the little kids
comes close enough, we should punish him for being so young and
blind.”

While standing guard at Joseph and Mary’s house during baby
Joseph’s Brit Milah ceremony, Timrok spotted a teenaged boy with
an evil spirit who had wandered within the inner radius. The boy
watched the King from around the corner. Timrok sent flashes of
light to signal the imminent danger to his team. The boy with the
demon lingers too long. Something has to be done.
Timrok pulled one sword partially from its sheath, and two
sparks of light flashed from its steel. Like a bolt of lightning, Prestus
shot down from above and took a stand in front of the demon.
Prestus’s wings folded away, and he drew his sword. He spoke to the
demon within the boy.
“What is your business here, foul spirit?”
“No business at all, puny puppet. We are just passing through.”
“Then you should continue on. I will not permit any of your evil
deeds here at this celebration today.”
“Suppose I do make this gathering my business—what are you
going to do to stop me?”
From around another corner, Timrok stepped into the street,
flanked by Kylek and Micah. Without drawing their weapons, Kylek
and Micah put their clenched fists on their hips. Timrok crossed his
arms. Silence filled the air of the Middle Realm. The four angelic
warriors waited for the demon’s next move. A full minute passed.
Muscles drew tight. Eyes stayed fixed.
“Come, little brother,” the demon spoke to the boy. “I am bored
with this stupid party. Let’s go someplace more interesting.”
Timrok and his three warriors watched the enemy and his
flesh-host skulk away. They passed beyond Timrok’s outer perimeter.

Without a word Prestus, Kylek, and Micah disappeared to their posts.
Timrok turned and marched back to the house.
The children ran and played with wild abandon. Standing near
the outside wall of the house, Joseph and Raziel huddled close for a
private conversation. Elric stood close.
Timrok approached. “Captain,” Timrok said, “an enemy warrior
wandered within our inner perimeter, but we have—”
Elric held up his hand and waved Timrok closer. “Come listen,”
he said.
Raziel continued, “It is truly remarkable!” The volume of Raziel’s
voice stayed low, but his enthusiasm bubbled high.
Joseph asked, “The tutoring is going well, then? You don’t think
Jesus is too young?”
“On the contrary. He is more advanced at six years old than
most teenagers I have taught. He is focused; he learns quickly; he
seems to remember everything after being taught just once. And it’s
more than that.” Raziel stopped and looked around. “His ability to
learn and assimilate Scriptures is almost scary. When I read Scriptures
with Him, it’s almost like—like it is not the first time He has heard
it. It is as though all I am doing is reminding Him of something He
already knew. And then, once He has heard it, He practically has it
memorized! It’s amazing! I have never seen anything like it.”
“Then, you are still happy to continue the tutoring?”
“Happy? You could not keep me from it. There is definitely
something about this boy, and I want to be a part of whatever is
going on.”
“Is He asking difficult questions?”

“No. He seems to be completely in a receiving position. He is

reached down and tossed it back to Jesus, who caught it and ran off
amid the shouts and laughter of the energetic pack.
The two men laughed.
“Come,” Raziel said, “I keep you from your party.”
The two went back inside the house.
Elric turned to Timrok and asked, “I’m sorry, you have a report?”

sandals? He sat up and looked at his feet. Mud covered his feet and
sandals. He checked his arms again.
“Levi,” Daniel whispered, “what’s going on?”

“What do you mean?” Daniel heard in his right ear.
“I put my night clothes on when I went to bed last night, and
I know there were no scratches on my arms. And this morning . . . ”
He looked again at his shoes and arms.
“Surely you do not think I did this to you.”
“Well, no, but . . . ”
Daniel jumped up and ran out of the house. He wandered out
behind the big olive tree in the back yard, whose gnarled trunk and
limbs had seen the stories of generations.
“I was obviously outside doing something last night,” Daniel
said.
“You must have been sleepwalking. Do you remember anything?”
“No.” Daniel smacked his forehead with the palm of his hand
and waded through the mud of missing memories and muddled
thoughts. “I don’t remember.”
I don’t even know my own thoughts anymore. I’m so angry, and
lonely, and confused. Sometimes I just want to hurt . . .
He stopped mid-thought and rubbed his forehead.
“Levi,” he said, “is it possible for me to hear your thoughts?”
No response.
“Levi?”
“Of course not. Why would you ask this?”
“I don’t know. Sometimes my thoughts seem like . . . ”
He couldn’t bring himself to say, or even think, an untapped
fountain of malice and evil just waiting to be unleashed, but that’s what
he felt.
Instead he paused and said, “Not my own. Dark, scary thoughts.”
“These are your own thoughts. We all have a darkness within.”

“But not like this,” Daniel said. “This is—”
“Guilt.”
“What?”
“Deep inside you know that if you hadn’t slipped and fallen that
day, you could have stopped the Roman soldier, and I would still be
alive.”
“Aughh!”
He looked around for somewhere to run away. There’s no place to
go. Nowhere to get away from Levi. He paced in circles, pulling his hair,
and hitting his forehead with his palms.
He walked circles around the old tree and muttered, “I hate
myself. I hate my life. I hate everyone.”

Two weeks later, Daniel awoke in the pre-dawn light after a
nightmare. He yawned and reached up to wipe the sleep from his
eyes.
He stopped short.
Dried blood covered his hand. Blood stains went all the way up
to his elbow.
He suppressed a scream and held up his other hand. More dried
blood. He leapt out of bed and shuffled to the front door, being
careful not to wake anyone. He grabbed the pitcher full of water
and ran behind the old olive tree out back. With frantic motions
he scrubbed the blood off his hands and arms. I don’t see any cuts
anywhere. The blood couldn’t be his.
“Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no,” he muttered as he washed.

CONTROL

369

Ughh—blood on my sandals, too. He had almost enough water left
to wash those. He did the best he could and covered the wet leather
with dirt and rubbed the dirt over the bloody spots. He checked the
fabric of his outer garment. Blood splatters. He pulled the tunic off,
wadded it into a ball, and slumped down on the ground with his back
against the tree.
“What is happening to me?” He buried his face into his tunic.
“Levi? Levi, are you there? You’re supposed to be my spiritual guide.
Tell me what’s going on.”
“You are powerful,” the voice said in his ear.
“What? I’m losing control!”
“Fear not. I am in control.”
Three weeks later, the same experience happened again.
Another two weeks later, it happened again.
A week after that, Daniel was tending the sheep alone in the
field, wide awake. The next thing he knew, he found himself in town
with wet hair. Half the afternoon had passed, and he had no idea
where he had been or what he had done during that time. A dog in
an alley barked and barked, backing away from him. Daniel slinked
away toward home, his eyes darting about for signs of any remnants
of mischief he might have done.

Elizabeth suffered bad colic today and, at the moment, she could not
be consoled. At the table over in the other corner, Raziel introduced
the syntactic behaviors of Greek lexical items to the eight–year–old
Jesus, but every time Elizabeth cried out, Jesus turned toward her.
Four–year–old James chased two–year–old Joseph around the room,
who laughed and squealed at full volume. On one pass, little Joseph’s
elbow knocked an empty cooking pot to the floor. It made a loud
clatter.
“James! Joseph! Settle down!” Mary shouted.
Elric smiled. How many times over the ages have I watched this
scene?
His mind drifted back to another family back in the days when
Israel still lived in the wilderness under Moses. Back when Elric had
the charge of Kenaz, the younger brother of Caleb, son of Jephunneh
of the tribe of Judah.
Elric stood like a statue in the corner of Kenaz’s tent, his arms
crossed, watching the midday mayhem fill the tent. Kenaz’s wife
bounced a three–month–old baby girl on her shoulder. She suffered
bad colic today and, at the moment, could not be consoled. Four–
year–old Othniel chased two–year–old Seraiah around the room,
who laughed and squealed at full volume. On one pass, Seraiah’s
elbow knocked a platter of manna to the floor. It made a loud clatter.
“Othniel! Seraiah! Settle down!” the mother shouted.
Elric smiled and stepped outside.
Rubbing his arms, he closed his eyes and tilted his nose upward.
The tension is building. Strife fills the air. On the other side of camp,
a dark cloud rose in the Middle Realm from among the tents. Korah.
He is stirring up dissension among the Levites against Moses and Aaron.

371

The words of rebellion spoken by the men rose into the air of the
Middle Realm and coalesced into a cloud, blocking out all light from
the Throne. These men—they have no idea they are giving legal right for
the enemy to invade the camp. They are inviting it.
A full battalion of beaelzurim appeared and swirled above the
cloud.
Here it comes.
The demons dove downward through the cloud. Crashing and
clanging steel rang out in the Middle Realm. Out at the edge of the
camp, more battle cries sounded.
Elric’s hand went for his sword, and he unfurled his wings. He
stopped. He looked back at the tent with Kenaz’s family inside. He let
out a long exhale, folded his wings, and pushed his sword back into
place. He looked toward the tent of meeting, where the pillar of fire
spiraled upward for all to see—the very presence of the spirit of the
King in the center of the camp. The King’s presence is physically visible,
and still, men choose to rebel. He shook his head.
He closed his eyes and longed for the days before all this strife
and rebellion. He raised his hands and counted off the tempo for a
new song of worship. He brought his hands down to start the song,
but there was no music. He opened his eyes. He had no choir—only
the rising smoke of strife and the sounds of war. Tears welled up in his
eyes. His heart felt like it would burst.
“Someday,” he said aloud. “Someday, the King will restore all
things.”
He stared at the dark cloud rising on the other side of camp, and
a hollow ache gripped his heart. And it’s going to be a long, long time
before that day.

Jesus jumped up from the table and shook Elric’s attention back
into the present.
Jesus ran over to his crying sister in Mary’s arms. He rubbed her
little head and whispered, “It’s all right, it’s all right.”
She settled down, and Jesus went back to the table with Raziel.
“Tell me, why do you jump up to check on little Elizabeth when
she cries?” Raziel asked.
Elric smiled. I know why. And I suspect you do, too.
“Her tummy hurts, and she needs me,” Jesus said.
Elric rubbed his chin and waited to hear how Raziel would
handle this moment. He was a skilled teacher, wise in the Scriptures
and Jewish traditions. And, he was a worthy mentor, wise in the ways
of life and more interested in pleasing God than pleasing men.
“I see,” Raziel said. “So tell me, whose job is it to care for the
little babies?”
“The Lord, our Father, of course. He takes care of everyone.”
“Yes, very good. I agree. But how does He do that—most of the
time?”
“What do you mean?”
“I mean, who actually prepares your food, cleans up all the
messes, and tucks you and your brothers in at night?”
“Ima does that.”
“That’s right. The Lord is taking care of you, but He is using
your ima to do it. You see, God likes order. He sets up authorities
over us to take care of us and help us keep His laws. So, while it
is very good that you care about your little sister, at the same time
you need to trust that God is going to take care of her through your
parents. We all have our own responsibilities. Your parents take care

friends, of course.”
They both laughed.
“I can do that.”
“I knew you could,” Raziel said. “Now, we only have a little
more to do. Then we will be done for today.”
Elric closed his eyes and took a deep breath. His heart felt like
it would burst again, but not with a longing for a distant future. The
time is close. The King is finally here, and the time is close.

Dawn had just broke, and Jeremiah and Daniel stood outside
their house. Jeremiah thundered, “It’s one thing when you disappear
and neglect your duties at home and in the field, but then there was
the incident with the men in town, and now this?”
Daniel “awoke” to find himself in the middle of his father’s tirade.
He had no idea how he had gotten there or what his father had said
before that last sentence. He looked around to see what “this” thing
he had done might be. He checked himself. Bloodstains covered his
hands, his arms, the whole front of his tunic.
“These are our neighbors, our friends,” his father continued.
“How could you do such a thing to their dog? They say they saw
you torture and mutilate it last night. And when they tried to stop
you, you threatened to do the same to them! What do you say to
this?”

374

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Daniel looked down at his blood–stained hands. He didn’t have
anything to say. He kept looking at his hands, first the palms, then
the backs, then the palms again. He could not deny he had done the
deed, but he found it interesting he had no remorse. Just emptiness.
And power.
“I don’t even know you anymore,” Jeremiah said with a defeated,
disappointed tone. “I know the loss of Levi was hard for you. It was
hard for all of us. But over the last five years, you have become a
completely different person. We have been putting up with your
attitude and have been lax about your responsibilities—hoping that
eventually you would . . . would . . . be normal. But this is too much.
You bring dishonor and shame to our family. And more than this, I
fear you may do something worse.”
Daniel stared at his bloody hands with a blank expression.
“You leave me no choice,” Jeremiah said. He turned his back
on Daniel and took a single step toward the house. “From this day
forward, you are no longer my son. You are dead to me.” Bitter tears
carved a path down his cheeks and disappeared into his beard. “Go—
you are a stranger and are not welcome in my house.”
Without looking back, Jeremiah walked to the door, pulled it
open, stepped inside, and pulled it shut. The lock bolt clanged into
place, and then—silence. Oppressive silence. It smothered Daniel
and choked out his breath.
My whole life just disappeared behind that door. Anger percolated
up from his gut, pressurized his brain, and shot back down his whole
body. He shuddered.
“Let’s teach them a lesson, little brother,” the voice said in his
ear. “He can’t do this to us.”

Daniel reached for the bloody knife he had hidden in his cloak,
pulled it out, and took a step toward the door. Everything else in the
world blurred away, awash in blood–red rage. Only that closed door
remained. The door that just shut him out. The man behind that
door that would feel the sting of his . . .
“Daniel,” a cheerful voice called out from his left side. “You are
up early. What are you doing?”
Daniel’s intense focus shattered like glass. He froze. He jerked
his head toward the voice. It’s Jesse! His eldest brother approached
from over the nearby hill to the south.
Run!
Like a panicked wild animal, Daniel broke into an all–out run to
the north. He ran and ran and ran, too afraid to look back. His legs
started screaming. His heart pounded in his ears. Finally, he stopped
and bent over, his burning, heaving lungs unable to continue. He
straightened up and looked behind. No one chasing him. Still panting
hard for air, he lumbered forward.
He passed through Nazareth just long enough to steal a skin flask
and fill it with water. Pressing hard down a trail, he shot desperate
glances over his shoulder every dozen steps. An hour passed, and
nobody seemed to be following. He settled into a slower pace.
Where am I going to go? Everyone around here knows me. I need to
get to some place new. Someplace completely different. The Sea of Galilee.
I loved it there. That’s it, I’ll start a new life by the water.

gaining ground on every front. Sickness, demon possession, leprosy,
corruption, strife—the advances of the enemy are accelerating.”
“The King’s honor is being openly challenged,” Timrok said.
“Just look at this. And yet we do not fight. Instead, we are hiding.”
“Waiting,” Lacidar said.
“I see pain,” Jenli said. “Every one of these is a wound to the
heart of the King. I sense great pain from the Throne.”
“What do you see, Captain?” Zaben asked.
Elric rubbed his chin and shook his head. “It’s what I do not see.
Everything here seems to point to the imminent Day of the Lord, but
the day remains hidden.”
“Why does He continue to withhold information we need?”
Zaben said.
Elric clenched his teeth and raised his eyebrows high. His left eye
twitched twice.
Lacidar stepped up. “We have all we need for our present station.
Everything about this mission is a mystery hidden in Him from the
beginning of time. We knew this when we started. We continue our
assigned tasks. And we wait.”
Elric nodded. “Yes, well said. And this we shall do.” He paused
and stared deep into the map. “But we are close. I can sense the
nearness of the day.”
After a lingering final survey of the map, Elric stepped back
and crossed his arms. “Lacidar,” he said, “do you have a report from
Judea?”
“Despite our best efforts,” Lacidar said, “the enemy has infiltrated
the religious leaders in Zacharias’s synagogue. They are all against

378

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Zacharias, and there is talk amongst them of cutting Zacharias off,
banning him from the synagogue.”
Elric nodded without flinching. “And how about John?”
“John progresses well. He is almost eleven. Zacharias tutors the
boy and has built a significant collection of scrolls of Moses and the
prophets at home, so John has ample access to the Scriptures. Zacharias
seems to sense his time is limited, so he is pouring everything he can
into John while there is yet time. John has personally accepted his
Nazirite vow and is strong in the spirit.”
“This is good news. Has the word of the Lord come to him yet?”
“No.”
Elric took a deep breath and gazed back at the map.
“Sir?” Lacidar said. “What about Jesus? How are things going in
Nazareth?”
Elric laughed. “Yes, I forget you do not get to see Him as we
do. Everything is quiet there. Jenli and Zaben provide an excellent,
invisible–yet–strong outer perimeter. Timrok’s inner perimeter is
impenetrable.”
Timrok crossed his burly arms and nodded.
“Of course,” Elric said, “I can tell the King is hiding us under
His shadow, so the enemy has not been able to draw near.”
Jenli slapped Timrok’s shoulder, and all the lieutenants laughed.
“But,” Elric interrupted with an upraised hand, “but . . . all those
who have gotten close have been diverted with the utmost skill, valor,
and discretion.”
Timrok nodded again and said with his arms still crossed, “With
valor.”
The lieutenants laughed. Elric smiled.

Elric continued. “Mary has had another son. They have named
him Simon. It is perfect—they look like a very normal family in every
way. There is nothing remarkable at all to draw the attention of the
enemy.”
“Except the King Himself!” Timrok said.
“Yes, of course,” Elric said, “but even He appears normal. The
Father is hiding the light of Jesus’ spirit from the enemy, and in His
flesh, He appears like any other ten–year–old boy.”
“What is He like now?” Lacidar asked. “Does He understand
who He is?”
“I think so,” Elric said. “The Father speaks to Him constantly.
The rabbi Raziel is an excellent human mentor, but I can tell that
Jesus’ wisdom is growing through revelation in His spirit.”
“Does He see you?” Lacidar asked.
“No—at least I don’t think so. Sometimes I think He can sense
our presence, but His focus is always on the Father—or the people
around Him.”
“Does He know what His mission here is yet?”
“It is hard to tell. I don’t think He does. In almost every respect,
He is just another young boy. Right now, His world is all about
playing and learning and being part of a family. Joseph has begun
teaching Him some basic carpentry skills, and everyone assumes Jesus
will follow in Joseph’s footsteps.”
“It is just amazing,” Lacidar said.
Elric noticed Zaben examining a portion of the map, absorbed
in his own thoughts.
“What is it, Zaben?” Elric said.
“I was just looking at King David.”

for a time. Then, after Solomon, it dimmed and spiraled off into a tiny
filament that threaded through clouds and vortices of blackness. Here
in Nazareth on the map, the string became flat again and straight—
and brilliant. Elric moved down by the map where Zaben stood.
“What do you see?” Elric asked.
“David was more than just the line through whom the King
would come. He was a shadow of the Messiah.”
“Yes.”
“David was first anointed king by Samuel as a boy of twelve,”
Zaben said.
“Jesus is already ten,” Timrok said.
Zaben nodded and pointed to a spot on the map. “And David
slayed Goliath when he was fifteen.”
“And conquered many Philistines,” Timrok said.
Zaben continued. “What if we are only two years away from—”
“The prophet John has not even begun his ministry yet,” Lacidar
said. “The word of the Lord has not even come to him.”
“I know,” Zaben said, “but what if the word comes to him
sometime within the next two years, and he anoints Jesus as King
when He is twelve. Then John spends the next three years preparing
the way, helping raise an army. Then, at fifteen the Lord’s campaign
begins. He slays the Goliath of Rome and destroys His enemies.”
Everyone stood in silence, looking at the map.
Jenli shook his head. “But David didn’t sit on the throne over all
Israel until he was thirty. And most of those years, he spent running
for his life, hiding in caves.”

Zaben nodded. “This is what I have been searching out. I thought
the Lord would defeat His enemies in a single day. This does not fit.”
Everyone stood in silence.
“David defeated Goliath in a single day,” Lacidar said. “But it
took years to subdue the Philistines. Perhaps, the King’s campaign
will take time, too.”
“Captain?” Zaben said. “You have been silent.”
Elric first rubbed his chin, then crossed his arms. “This is all
interesting. And I want to hasten that day as much as any. However,
the shadows of the fathers do not provide true light. Only a word
from the throne.” He paused. “One thing I do believe—when that
word does come, the very nature of our mission will change.”
“We stop hiding,” Timrok said, “and fight for the King.”

“Is this all your report?” Marr asked.
“Yes, my lord,” the three commanders muttered in nervous

Augustus in Rome to remove Archelaus from power.”
Asherah shot hateful glances toward Molech and Yarikh. The
two smirked without taking their eyes off Marr.
Marr continued. “Augustus has had enough—enough uprisings,
enough complaints about Archelaus, enough troubles with the
Herodian regime. I have, therefore, decided to cut off the rule of
Herod’s house over Judea and Samaria and place it directly under
the authority of Rome. I have a man ready—a Roman cavalry officer
currently under Quirinius in Syria. Asherah’s region will become a
Roman province, and this man, Coponius, will be its first governor.”
“But, my lord,” Asherah said.
“You will retain authority over the region.”
Asherah crossed his gigantic arms across his chest and lifted his
chin. Molech and Yarikh sneered.
“What is the value of this move?” Molech asked through gritted
teeth.
Marr looked at the fireball pulsing in the air above his fingertips.
He gave it a spin with a flick of his fingers, and it whirred in place
with a low hum while sparks and bits of flame flung outward.
“None of you will be able to find the Child. Of this I am
sure. He will raise an army and launch His campaign. But, with
the region of Judea under direct Roman control, I will have the
full force of the Roman Empire at my disposal without this layer
of Herodian politics.” Marr sat back on his throne and gave the
fireball another spin. “Roman control also changes the role of the
chief priest in Israel—who will have to be the liaison between the
Jewish people and Rome. His role will become more political, and

since he controls the temple treasury, we shall create a corrupt

Marr slowly squeezed the fireball between his finger and thumb,
and it shrank amid crackling sparks and sizzling smoke. He squashed
the energy to nothing and blew the small cloud of black smoke away
with a single puff.
He continued. “Begin preparing for a succession of chief priests.
Once we find our man and establish his position, we will keep him in

“This is Molech and Yarikh’s fault,” Asherah said. “They are

“I hate them.” A small plasma ball formed in his hand. He gave it a

“And the elzurim of the King,” he said. “They resist me at

“And Marr.” Asherah ground his teeth and clenched his fists.
“Over the last ten years, I have accomplished much with Archelaus.
So many deaths, so much rebellion, so much chaos and dissension.
Marr should be rewarding me for my masterful leadership. Instead, he
extends his own reach into my dominion and installs his own man.”
Asherah formed a dozen fireballs and fired them off in rapid
succession. He sat back on his throne and took a deep breath. He
watched with disinterest as Coponius’s men moved furniture around in
the palace headquarters and hung Roman shields and accouterments
on the walls.
“At least my throne is still in its proper place,” he mumbled.
“These men will always come and go, but my throne spans the
generations.”
Aside from the background noise of men working, the air in
the Middle Realm became pregnant with silence. Asherah could feel
the stares of his captains. He shifted on his throne and sat up. He
positioned his arms on the armrests and cleared his throat.
“The first order of business will be to confiscate all Herod’s
estates held by Archelaus for the possession of Rome. Next, we will
institute a rigorous tax plan. Most importantly, though, we are going
to take control of the functions of the office of the Jewish high priest
and place a man of our choosing into that position. See to it that
everything is prepared to accomplish these goals quickly. I will begin

“This is the Judas who began the sect of Zealots?” Elric asked.
“Yes,” Zaben said. “He is calling the whole nation to assert their
liberty and stand against the Romans. He has been active for years.”
Jenli said, “The new taxes levied by Coponius have stirred him
and the priest Zadok to lead a revolt. He calls the taxation no better
than an introduction of slavery. Many supporters are joining him.”
“Why does he come to Nazareth?” Elric asked.
“He is going town to town,” Jenli said, “driving Roman
occupation forces out and building more support.”
“This is an enemy ploy,” Zaben said. “An attempt to sweep away
innocent people—and possibly the King—in open warfare.”
“I agree,” Elric said. “We must prevent them from entering
Nazareth. Where can we divert them?”
“Sepphoris is just four miles from here,” Jenli said.
“Yes,” Elric said. “That is good. There is a Roman armory there.
Go down and convince Judas that Nazareth is not worthy of their
effort. There is little Roman presence here, and Sepphoris is a better
prize.”
“In His service,” Jenli and Zaben said in unison. They opened
their wings and disappeared in a single stroke.
Elric remained on the brow of the hill and watched. Minutes
later a large dust storm rose in front of the advancing army and
washed over it. The entire troop came to a halt. For an extended time,
the army stayed swallowed in blinding dust and wind. Eventually,
the wind died down, but the army remained motionless for another

the direction of Sepphoris.

get them to move on farther south and bypass Nazareth altogether.”
“Very good. Inform your team and Zaben’s. We need extra

the danger to the King is still very grave. I will tell Timrok.”

Joseph and Jesus worked at a construction site in Nazareth,
building up a good sweat. Along with a crew of half a dozen men,

days since Judas the Galilean took Sepphoris, and Elric and Timrok
stood guard at the worksite with swords drawn. The two angels
faced in opposite directions. Their eyes caught every movement of

“I prefer wood projects,” Joseph said to Jesus as he hoisted a large
stone off a pile. “Tables, wagons, animal pens, out-shacks.” He moved

work that comes along. And it’s time you learned to work with stone.”
Joseph moved another stone aside. “What we are looking for
is a stone we will use as the cornerstone for the building. It is the
most important stone we will set today because it will become
the foundation off which everything else will be built. It has to be
perfectly square, level, and true.”

Jesus struggled with a stone less than half the size of the one
Joseph had just moved.
He finally conquered it, and one of the other workmen beside
Him said, “You have a strong boy here, Joseph.”
Stepping up next to Jesus, the man said, “Let me see those
muscles.”
Jesus flexed His muscles and showed off His biceps, which the
man felt with exaggerated amazement.
“Yes, you are a strong one. How old are you, son?”
“Almost twelve.”
“Well, I’m glad to have you on the crew today. You listen to your
father—he is a good man. He will teach you everything you need to
know.”
“Yes, sir.”
“You know,” Elric said to Timrok over his shoulder, “the irony of
everything He does is overwhelming. Here He is, the very cornerstone
of all creation, being taught the importance of a cornerstone by a
man.”
Timrok laughed. “And a man pretending that the King is strong
by squeezing His little biceps.”
“Every day He amazes me,” Elric said.
“Did you hear about what happened in Sepphoris yesterday?”
Joseph said, loud enough for the whole crew.
One of the men answered. “I heard that Judas the Zealot routed
the Roman detachment there and looted their armory earlier this
week.”
“Ha!” another worker said. He lifted a stone and tossed it onto a
pile. “Kill them all, I say.”

“I heard several men from Nazareth went over to join the cause,”
another worker said.
“You haven’t heard, then, have you?” Joseph said.
The workers all stopped and looked at Joseph.
Joseph’s voice became low and solemn. “The Roman army
attacked Judas and crushed his army.”
“All of them?”
“Two thousand survived, but they were captured and are all to
be crucified.”
All the workers’ jaws dropped. No one moved. No one blinked.
Jesus watched all their reactions. He looked up at Joseph.
“And Judas?” one asked.
“He is to be executed, too,” Joseph said.
A squad of eight Roman soldiers appeared on the trail and
marched by the worksite. A beaelzur warrior walked alongside. The
soldiers marched past, eying the work crew: seven sweaty men and a
boy, standing defenseless amid piles of building stones. The demon
eyed Elric and Timrok. Elric prepared his sword.
“Keep moving,” the demon said to the Roman squad leader.
The squad passed out of sight, and Elric and Timrok resumed
their vigilant watch. The men relaxed and went back to work.
One worker put his hand on Jesus’ shoulder. “You keep working
on those muscles, son. Someday . . . someday a leader will rise out
of Israel, and he will save us from all this. Maybe, if you’re strong
enough, you’ll be able to fight with him.”

Daniel awoke with blood on his hands.
“Not again! Levi?”
Daniel stumbled down to the edge of the Sea of Galilee and
leaned forward to scrub his hands and arms in the water. His skin
bristled each time he submerged his arms, and he sucked air with
each chilling splash. He looked at his tunic.
“Ughh,” he sighed.
He pulled the tunic off and threw it in the water, not gently, and
scrubbed the new blood stains against the rocks. After getting the tunic
as clean as he could, he plodded back to his campsite and stretched the
tunic out on a tree limb. He sat with his head between his knees and
fought through the fog in his head. The anger and hatred simmering
just below the surface rose to a full boil. He pictured all the fights
he’d had with people in the towns. He thought about all the food and
supplies he’d stolen to survive. He thought about the loneliness of his
worthless existence. He imagined having to face people in town, not
knowing what, or who, he had killed during the night.
“Levi,” he said, “now we have to move again. This is the third
time we have had to move in the last three years. First Tiberias, then
Magdala, and now Gennesaret. I was afraid we were going to go to
jail after Magdala. I still don’t know how we escaped that. We don’t
dare take a chance of staying here now. What’s the next lake town to
the north, Capernaum?”
“Actually,” Daniel heard in his ear, “I was thinking we should go
down to Jerusalem for the festival. It starts in about two weeks.”
“Passover? I don’t care about that. I hate everything about the
religion of my father. Why would we go there?”

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

392

“Perhaps the King will be there. Perhaps we could see Him.”
“What?” Daniel said.
“I mean, think of all the opportunities to find new supplies.
Thousands of people staying in tents all around the city. Everything
out in the open. And not just that—think about the money. All the
moneychangers and merchants in the outer temple court. All the
people pressing in and all the chaos.”
“I could make a fortune,” Daniel said. “It would be easy.”
“Especially with your skills.”
Daniel paused, only briefly. “Let’s do it. This could be a new start
for me. I could steal enough money to be comfortable for a long time.
I could even move back up here to Capernaum and maybe get a real
job. Maybe be a fisherman. I’ve always wanted to do that.”
“Good choice,” the voice said in his ear. “I have a feeling there
are great possibilities waiting for us in Jerusalem.”
***
Elric and the lieutenants huddled around the war map. Faces
looked solemn, but eyes sparkled with anticipation.
“Tomorrow the caravan from Nazareth leaves for Jerusalem,”
Elric said. “This Passover pilgrimage is no different from any other
we’ve taken over the last ten years.”
The lieutenants’ heads nodded, but their eyes told a different
story.
Elric cleared his throat. He turned to Lacidar. “Zacharias and
Elizabeth will be coming up for the festival?”
“Yes, Captain. And the prophet John.”

393

“Right. Very good.”
Elric gazed off into the map with his arms crossed and jaw tight.
“Captain,” Lacidar said, “shall I arrange a meeting between Jesus
and John?”
Elric paused, still searching the map, and said, “No. Without
word from the Throne, I think it best to avoid forcing anything.
Don’t prevent it, but don’t initiate it.”
“Yes, sir,”
Everyone stood in silence, staring into the map. It became so
quiet in the Middle Realm that Elric noticed Hannah on the other
side of the room. She hummed a psalm and lit an oil lamp. Elric
smiled.
“Captain?” a voice said from behind.
Elric and the lieutenants turned toward the voice. Grigor stood
behind them, sleek and silent.
“Grigor!” Elric said. “We didn’t hear you come in.”
“A word of the Lord for Captain Elric,” Grigor said.
Elric waved his hand over the map, which disappeared, and
he moved to the corner of the room with Grigor. The conference
didn’t last long. Elric nodded his head several times and received a
parchment from Grigor.
“In His service,” Elric said.
“By His word,” Grigor replied. He opened his wings and shot
through the roof with a flash.
Elric stepped back to the lieutenants, trying hard to hold back
a smile.
“What is it?” Timrok asked.
“Do we have new direction?” Jenli asked.

394

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Not exactly,” Elric said. He took a deep breath, and then
couldn’t contain it anymore. His whole face erupted in a smile. “This
trip is going to be a pivotal one.”
“I knew it!” Zaben shouted.
Elric held up his hand. “Grigor did not say the King would start
His campaign now. He only said that the Son would be tested by the
Father.”
“He will pass the test. He will pass the test,” Zaben said, bouncing
on his toes.
“And,” Elric said, “I have received a list of the Son’s inner circle.
Twelve names.”
“The King’s generals,” Timrok said. “Excellent.”
“May we see the list?” Jenli asked.
Elric handed him the scroll. Jenli held the parchment out, and
the others crowded around.
“I have been away from my regular duties for too long,” Jenli
said. “I do not recognize any of these men.”
“I saved a pair of brothers, Simon and Andrew, during Herod’s
time,” Timrok said, looking at the list. “But they would be too young
to be generals, and they lived by Bethlehem.”
“There was a Judas in Kerioth that I rescued,” said Zaben. “But
he would be too young, too.”
“We do not have time to muster the generals now,” Elric said.
“We need to focus on our current mission. Our primary goal is still
to keep the King hidden. After this trip, we will search out these other
men.”
“And start raising the King’s army!” Timrok said.
“Where is Lacidar?” Elric asked.

ANTICIPATION

395

Everyone looked around the room.
“Where did he go? I didn’t see him leave,” Elric said.
Lacidar descended through the ceiling and alighted in front of
the group.
Elric shook his head. “What are you doing?”
Lacidar pulled his Lacidian resonar from behind his back. “I
couldn’t help it. This calls for a celebration!”
Lacidar strummed the resonar once and closed his eyes. Then
his fingers let loose, and a fast tune charged the room with jubilant
energy.
“Ha ha!” shouted Timrok. He spun twice in the air and came
down with his feet bouncing. He locked arms with Jenli, and the
two danced like wild children. Zaben joined the dance—twirling,
jumping, shouting.
“The King is here!” Lacidar sang.
“The King is here!
Victory, victory, the King is here!
His enemies are scattered, the evil days are shattered,
Victory, victory, the King is here!”
Elric stood back against the wall, smiled, and closed his eyes. He
raised his right hand, found the beat with his finger, and directed the
song as though he had a full choir.
On the other side of the room, Hannah hummed to herself.
“The King is here, the King is here.”

PASSOVER BEGINS

Baptism minus 18 years, Day 1 of Passover

O

n the first day of Passover, Elric stationed himself in the Court
of the Gentiles before Solomon’s Portico. Jesus sat behind him,
under the shade of the portico with a class of other young

students. A prominent–looking rabbi in a distinguished robe led the
class, but Elric couldn’t hear any of their discussions. As long as I can’t
hear them, none of the enemy outside this radius can, either. Timrok and his
team kept the same radius, the last buffer before the King.

Thousands of people scurried and milled about, while Elric stood
like a statue, six full feet taller than any man and larger than most of
the beaelzurim there. From where he stood, he tracked the movement
396

PASSOVER BEGINS

397

of every enemy in the court. Zaben and Jenli’s team had melted into
the crowd, but occasionally Elric spotted one of them working.
Amongst the teeming crowd in the courtyard, one man,
accompanied by a beaelzurim, walked in a direction that would bring
them within earshot of the little class in the shade. At the prompting
of Kaylar, a friend of the man called his name, diverting him in a
different direction. Another man with a demon escort was turned
away by the prompting of the demon himself, who preferred to avoid
contact with Prestus, approaching on an intercept course. Elric stood
motionless with his arms crossed in the middle of all the chaotic
motion and turned back beaelzurim with nothing more than a
commanding stare. One demon didn’t get the message and continued
forward. He met the horizontal barricade of Elric’s sword at chest
level. After a brief moment of a defiant gaze, the demon turned and
snaked off. One by one, individual by individual, Elric’s warriors gave
the King the space He needed without being detected or overheard.
***
In the shade of Solomon’s Portico, surrounded by towering
thick white columns, a gray–bearded sage shared his ancient wisdom
with two dozen wide–eyed teenaged boys seated at his feet. Jesus
positioned Himself near the front, taking in and weighing every
word. Raziel stood behind the class and grasped the lapels of his robe
with satisfaction as he watched his apprentice interact with the senior
rabbi.
One of the younger students dared to ask a challenging question,
although his bravery was belied by his thin, crackling voice. “I always

398

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

feel bad for the animals,” the boy said. “Why do we have to kill so
many? I mean, it’s not like God does anything with them. We just
slaughter them, and it seems like such a waste.”
The rabbi stroked his beard and raised his bushy eyebrows. “This
is an excellent question—one that reaches to the very heart of our
religion.” He paused. “I would like to turn this question back to
the class. Does anyone here know the answer to this very important
question?”
For a moment all the boys looked around at each other, no one
knowing what to say. Jesus popped His hand straight up in the air.
“Yes, young man?”
“It is because it satisfies the Holiness of God.”
“Yes, yes, very good. Let us explore that thought. What does it
mean to ‘satisfy’ His holiness? Here is the real issue: He is perfectly
holy, but we . . . we are not. Remember the words of King David, ‘For
no person living is righteous in Your sight.’ So, if He is absolutely holy
and we are unrighteous, how can we ever hope to stand before His
throne? Let me try to create a picture in your mind of His holiness.
Listen to the words of the prophet Isaiah.”
His voice became low and theatrical, and he stretched out his
arm like a great orator. He started softly. “‘In the year of King Uzziah’s
death, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofty and exalted, with
the train of His robe filling the temple. Seraphim stood above Him,
each having six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he
covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called out to another
and said, “Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is
full of His glory.” And the foundations of the thresholds trembled
at the voice of him who called out, while the temple was filling with

smoke. Then I (Isaiah) said, “Woe is me, for I am ruined! Because I
am a man of unclean lips; and I live among a people of unclean lips;
for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.”’” By the time he
reached the end, his voice boomed across the stone alcove.
The rabbi stopped speaking and lowered his hand. Every eye
fixed on the great sage, and while the rest of the world buzzed all
around them, their little corner froze with anticipation.
His voice became low and controlled, and he began again. “So, I
ask you, how can we stand before such a throne? What are we to do?”
Without hesitation Jesus popped His hand up again.
“Yes?” said the rabbi.
“He covers the sin with blood. According to Moses, ‘the life of
the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to
make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life
that makes atonement.’”
“Excellent,” the rabbi shouted. “This is exactly right!”
Raziel tightened the grip on his lapels, smiled, and looked
around.
The rabbi continued. “Atonement, Kippur . . . it is by the blood
of an innocent sacrifice that God has promised to forgive us for our
sins. Today I am going to teach you a new word, one which most of
you have probably never heard before. But it is an important word
and a key concept for you to understand. The word is ‘propitiation.’
It is a legal term that means ‘an act which appeases the wrath of an
offended party and reconciles the offender to the offended.’ As the
great Judge, God has agreed to accept the death of a substitute as a
‘propitiation’ for our offenses. This is what the blood of the sacrifices
does for us, both as a nation and as individuals. Does everyone

400

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

understand? Good, good. Very good question. Let’s take another
question.”
Jesus raised an eager hand. The rabbi nodded.
“What if a person became the sacrifice?”
The students in the class gasped and looked at Jesus. They sat
with mouths open in the silence. They turned back to the rabbi.
“Well, now,” the rabbi said, stroking his beard, “let us think about
this. As you all may know, this is a practice that has been observed
by heathen peoples, but we would never consider offering a human
sacrifice. First of all, remember that humans are made in the likeness
of God, so to kill a human is an offense to God and His greatest
creation. Every human life is too valuable, and God would never ask
any person to forfeit his own life in this manner. Second, that sacrifice
could only be applied to one other person, so practically speaking
we would lose half the population on every Day of Atonement.” In
a playful sinister tone he added, “A very gruesome prospect indeed.”
The class chuckled. The rabbi smiled at their crinkled-up noses.
“But most importantly—and this is the main issue—the
sacrifice needs to be innocent, and as we have already discussed, no
man is sinless before God. Therefore, there is no person who would
be qualified to be the sacrifice.”
All the boys nodded.
Jesus had another question and an upraised hand. “God is perfect
and without sin. What if He became the sacrifice?”
The class gasped.
“You are an astute young man with very profound ideas,” the
rabbi said. “Yes, very profound indeed.”
He paused for a moment and rubbed his hand over his mouth
with a slow, deliberate gesture.

PASSOVER BEGINS

401

“To begin with, this, of course, is a hypothetical question only
because we all know it is impossible for God to die. He is the eternal
self-existent one Who knows no beginning or end. It is by His hand
that everything exists, so if He were to die, everything else would
also cease to exist, and the whole question is for naught. However,
hypothetically . . . what would happen? God would have to take on a
human form in order to die a sacrificial death. Because God, in that
case, is in a human form, and He is sinless and innocent, He would
certainly qualify to serve as the sacrifice. Also, because He is infinite,
I suppose His death could serve as a propitiation for all men, not just
one. And, since He is ageless, for all men for all time, past, present,
and future.”
The old rabbi stopped speaking. He smiled and raised his big
bushy eyebrows. “Yes, that would certainly be the perfect sacrifice,”
he said with a wistful tone. He laughed and pointed toward the boy
who had asked the original question. “And it would save many bulls
and goats.”
The rest of the class laughed along.
The remainder of the afternoon went by like a blur. Deep
thoughts, Scripture lessons, intriguing questions—impressionable
boys on the brink of manhood became caught up in the enchantment
of sitting at the feet of a wise old rabbi and surrounded by the majesty
of the great temple.
The last session finished, and Raziel brought Jesus back to the
camp where the whole troop from Nazareth stayed. A hundred
Nazarenes milled about rows of tents, mingling and celebrating the
first day of the Passover week. Groups of men talked and laughed
around campfires. Children darted around the tents from one end of
the camp to the other. The festival was underway.

O

n the morning of the second day of Passover, the marketplace
in Jerusalem teemed with people. Thousands of pilgrims
jostled through the streets, pushing from one vendor to the

next. Daniel weaved his way through the masses. In front of one vendor,
he bumped shoulders with a man on the street, fell backward, and
knocked a basket of matzo bread from the vendor’s stand to the ground.

“I’m so sorry,” Daniel said to the vendor, reaching for the fallen
bread.
The two scrambled and scooped the bread back into the basket.
With the vendor distracted, Daniel slipped two full handfuls under
402

his tunic. They finished picking up the bread, and Daniel hurried
down the street.
Daniel ducked into an alley and sat on an empty wooden crate.
He lifted his tunic and pulled out the bread, a handful of dates, and
a small wineskin. He leaned back against the building and popped a
date into his mouth.
“This was an excellent idea, Levi,” he said. “You were certainly
right about our opportunities here. Yesterday I got new sandals, a
blanket, a new knife, and enough food to last a week.”
He took a bite of bread and washed it down with a mouthful of
wine.
“And I do enjoy the wine.”
He ate some more bread.
“Today, I think I will find some new clothes. Maybe even a small
cart to haul all my belongings. And I need to find some money.”
“We need to go into the temple grounds,” Daniel heard in his
ear.
“No,” Daniel said. “I don’t want to go there. There is plenty for
us here on the streets.”
“The moneychangers are there. That is where we need to go.”
“But the vendors on the streets have money, and so do all the
people. Why go up to the temple?”
The voice became stern. “We go to the temple. Tomorrow.”
“Fine,” Daniel said. He tilted the wineskin back and finished
every last drop.

Elric stood in position in front of Solomon’s Portico. Zaben
moved in close. He looked up at the waning sun, then back at Jesus
who sat with the class.
“The afternoon grows long,” Zaben said. “Day two, and still no
pronouncement from the King?”
Elric’s gaze remained on the activities in the court. He answered
without moving his head. “There are seven days of the festival.”
“Is the prophet John here? Have you even seen him?”
“Zacharias brought him into the Court of Women, where he is
sitting under the tutelage of the rabbis there. Lacidar’s team is with
him.”
“Why does Jesus remain out here? He should be in an inner
court. Shall we move Him?”
Elric looked down at Zaben. He returned his attention back to
the outer court. “We do not move Him.”
“Yes, Captain. Of course.”
“Jesus and John will meet when the Lord chooses. I would not
expect anything this early in the week.”

Daniel stepped through the gate into the outer temple court on
the morning of the third day of the festival. Every fiber of his being
cringed, and he struggled to catch his breath. His eyes scanned the
expansive courtyard with all its columns and majestic architecture.
It is all I remembered it to be. He steadied himself against a wall. He
couldn’t move. Fear locked up every joint. Even though he didn’t

want to, he let his gaze drift up to the main temple structure, stark
white and imposing. His whole body shuddered.
“Don’t look at the temple,” Daniel heard in his ear.
“I don’t remember it being so scary before,” Daniel said.
“Don’t look at it. Keep your focus down here in the outer court.”
A choir of Levites began to sing under the colonnade to their
left.
Daniel shuddered and covered his good ear.
“Quickly,” the voice said. “We should move away to the other
side.”
Daniel forced his legs to move. He meandered through the
crowd, and he couldn’t help but scan everywhere, examining every
person.
“Why do I feel like I’m looking for something—or someone?”
Daniel asked.
He heard no answer.
“Levi?”
“Money, of course. We’re looking for opportunities to steal
money.”
“Right. Let’s get to work so we can get out of here.”
***
Baptism minus 18 years, Day 4 of Passover
As the sun set on the fourth day of Passover, Daniel started a
campfire at his hideout just outside the city. The wood crackled,
and sparks floated upward. Daniel pulled out his leather pouch and

406

dropped coins into it one at a time. With each clink of metal, he
smiled and nodded his head.
“This was a very good day, Levi,” he said. “Between yesterday
and today, I have enough money to live on for months. As much as
I don’t want to go back to the temple grounds, I think we should go
there again tomorrow.”
“Tomorrow,” the voice in his ear said, “we go into the Court of
Women.”
“An inner court? What for? There are no moneychangers there.”
No answer.
“You are looking for something, aren’t you?” Daniel said. “What
are you looking for?”
No answer.
“Well, I’m not going,” Daniel said. “I’ll go as far as the outer
court, but I refuse to go in any farther.”
“We will see.”

Baptism minus 18 years, Day 5 of Passover
On the fifth day of Passover, Vorsogh used Daniel’s body to climb
the fourteen steps to the Beautiful Gate. He had already helped Daniel
appropriate a sizable pocket of coins for the day, and he saw no sign of
the Child King anywhere in the outer court. Now I will take my turn.
With Daniel’s consciousness pushed aside, Vorsogh had full control of
Daniel’s flesh. He stepped into the Court of Women. A choir on his
right drove him to the far left. Even though concealed in flesh, Vorsogh
could feel the penetrating eyes of the senturim from each corner, and

he pressed as far under the colonnade as he could. He scanned the
court, being careful not to look upward toward the temple.
Hmm, over there—a small group of young students sitting at the
feet of a rabbi. From here, they looked to be about the right age. He
moved over for a closer look.
There! What is that? I don’t think that is the King Himself, but His
spirit is very strong on this boy. I wonder . . .
***
Baptism minus 18 years, Day 6 of Passover
John, the son of Zacharias, took his regular seat with the other
students in the Court of Women and waited for the day’s rabbi to
come out for this, the sixth day of Passover. These last five days of the
festival had been intoxicating. There seemed to be something special
about being this close to the temple—the buildings, the priests, the
smell of the sacrifices on the altar. He wanted more.
Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a young man, maybe
twenty years old, off to the side, watching. The man looked unkempt
and out of place. And there was something very unsettling about
his eyes—wild, unnatural. Why does it feel like he’s watching me? He
rubbed the bristled hair on his arms. And I’m not sure, but I think I saw
him yesterday, too. John looked back to where his mother, Elizabeth,
sat with the other women. She smiled and gave him a little wave. He
waved back.
The rabbi appeared, flanked by his apprentices with dozens of
scrolls tucked under their arms. The rabbi shuffled up to the front of
the group of students and sat down.

“Good morning, students,” the rabbi said with a cheerful voice.
“It is another beautiful day in the Lord’s house. Let’s get right into
our lesson for today.”
John sat with wide eyes for at least an hour. The lesson finished.
The rabbi rolled up a scroll, handed it back to an assistant, and said,
“We have time for questions. What is on your mind today?”
At first no one raised a hand. John slid his hand into the air.
“Yes, young man. What is your question?”
“Before the Messiah comes, the Scriptures say that Elijah is to
prepare His way. Is this Elijah himself, or just his prophetic anointing?”
“Well, now,” the rabbi said. “You want to dig into the deep
mysteries first thing in the morning? Very good.”
The rabbi pulled the sleeves back on his robe and crossed his
arms. “Prophecy is not an easy subject. We often can only surmise its
meaning from other contexts. But, from my understanding, I believe
it will be Elijah himself.”
John nodded.
“Is there more?” the rabbi asked. “I have a feeling I didn’t
completely answer your question.”
“Will the prophet know? Will he know he is Elijah?”
“Oh, yes, I most certainly think so. If he is Elijah, he will know
it.”
John nodded again.
“Good question,” the teacher said. “Is there another question?
Yes, over here.”

Elric and his lieutenants gathered outside Joseph and Mary’s tent
on the night after the seventh day of Passover. Jesus and the rest of
the family slept inside, and the remainder of the tent village rested in
the quiet of the night. Smoldering embers of old campfires died out
and became still.
“I don’t understand it,” Zaben said. “I was so sure we would see
Him anointed King this week.”
“And I thought the Son was to be tested,” Jenli said. “I did not
see any test. Did anyone else?”
Everyone shook their heads. They all stood with arms limp and
nothing to say.
Elric lifted his chin and rested his hand on his sword hilt. “Well,
tomorrow we return to Nazareth. It will be good to have the King
back in a more secure environment.” He turned to Lacidar. “Is John
returning home tomorrow, too?”
“No,” Lacidar said. “Zacharias was asked to stay another week
and help with some temple duties. Elizabeth and John will stay here
with him.”
“Very good,” Elric said.
Elric looked into the faces of his lieutenants and smiled. “This
changes nothing. Our mission continues as planned. If we were to be
fighting for the King today, He would have told us.”
The lieutenants nodded.
“Return to your posts. Stay vigilant. We are still very exposed.”
Mostly in unison, they answered, “Yes, Captain. In His service.”

E

lric stood guard outside Joseph and Mary’s tent in the late–
night calm on the day after the Passover festival. He thought
about the past week and couldn’t help but wish that things had

gone differently. If the King had begun His campaign, our duties would
have been very different tonight. He surveyed the sleepy camp and sighed.
Morning will start a busy day for these pilgrims. All the tents need be torn
down, packed, and loaded for the trip back home. He sighed again. I will
be glad to return to the safety of Nazareth.

Two hours before sunrise, Jesus awoke and slipped out of the
tent. Elric raised his eyebrows and scanned left and right. Jesus started

Elric flashed his blade. Timrok and two of his warriors appeared.
“It looks like He is headed into town,” Elric said.
“Where to? What for?” Timrok asked.
“I don’t know. I have received nothing from the Lord about this.
My guess is He is headed to the temple. He loves it there. Rally the
troops.”
In an instant, Zaben and Jenli’s teams maneuvered through
town, establishing safe corridors, and being inconspicuous. Timrok’s
team stayed close and hidden. Elric smiled to himself at the prowess
of his team. So quiet, so invisible, so effective.
Elric followed Jesus to the temple. By the time He got there,
Zaben and Jenli’s teams had established posts and tucked away out
of sight. The grounds felt peaceful and still, especially compared to
the bustle of the last week. Even the birds hadn’t begun singing yet.
An occasional priest crossed the courtyard, getting ready for the day.
Several vendors set up carts. A few crickets chirped. Jesus found an
out–of–the–way corner, settled in, and began praying.
Sunrise—activity picked up all around the grounds, the daily
temple routines began, and Jesus hadn’t moved from His prayer
corner.
Zaben walked over to Elric, who stood beside Jesus.
“I love the smell of the presence of His spirit,” Elric said with his
nose tilted upward.
“Yes. Yes, of course. But—”
“What is it?” Elric asked.

“The time is late. By now the caravan will already be loading and
getting ready to leave.”
Elric chuckled. “Yes, but . . . ” he looked over at Jesus deep in
prayer, “I am not going to interrupt that.”
“Perhaps a little whisper to Him that it is time to go?”
“If the Father wants Him to move, He will tell Him. We will
deal with the consequences as they develop.”
“You know the caravan will not wait.”
“You are right. You and Jenli go back to camp. Stall them if you
can, and get Mary and Joseph’s attention. Maybe Jesus will finish
here, and we will make it back in time.”
***
Back at the camp of the Nazarene pilgrims, the beasts of burden
had become restless and edgy. The men at the front of the caravan
struggled to get everything loaded for the trek and couldn’t understand
why everything seemed to be taking so long.
Joseph wrestled a large bag filled with food onto a camel near the
front of the caravan. He stopped. He cocked his head. “Has anyone
seen Jesus?”
A man nearby tried for the fourth time to get a large tent roll
secured to the back of a camel and answered, “No, I haven’t seen him
all morning.”
Another man with arms laden with water skins answered,
“Neither have I. I wonder if he is back with the women helping with
the rest of the children.”
“That must be it,” Joseph said.

THE TEST

413

Something in his gut kept nagging at him. He scanned for Jesus
through all the chaos. Ughh, there’s still so much work to get done. And
they were already behind schedule. Jesus is always so responsible. Surely,
He must be with Mary.
***
At the rear of the caravan, the women struggled with delays of
their own. Between crying babies and missing bits of this and that,
it seemed clear the troop wouldn’t be on the trail any time soon. In
the midst of the mayhem of loading the family donkey cart, Mary
realized she hadn’t seen Jesus all morning. She asked around, and
none of the kids knew where He was. None of the other women had
seen Him. Mary, being pregnant again—four months along—didn’t
have the energy to search all the way up to the front of the caravan.
Jesus had traveled with the men on the trip down to Jerusalem.
He is twelve now, after all. Surely He must be up front with Joseph.
***
After a frustrating half–morning delay, the caravan to Nazareth
finally began its amorphous plod outward. Hundreds of feet,
tromping beasts, and rattling wheels of carts kicked up a thick cloud
of dust and noise. With the company underway, Joseph fell back and
joined Mary with the cart and the children.
“That was painful,” Joseph hollered over the noise to Mary. He
took the reins of the donkey. “I don’t understand why that took so
long.”

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

414

Mary walked alongside Joseph. “Is Jesus up front with the other
men?”
“No. I haven’t seen Him all morning. I thought He was back
here helping you.”
“He’s not with me. I haven’t seen Him, either.”
Joseph looked at Mary. He looked back at the cart. James,
little Joseph, Elizabeth, and Simon all bounced around in the cart.
Elizabeth waved. Joseph waved back.
“You know Jesus,” Joseph said. “He’s always trying to help
everyone. He probably saw some work to be done and went to help.
I’m sure He’s with some of our relatives or another family who was
struggling to get loaded. He’ll show up once things settle down.”
“I don’t know,” Mary said. “I have a strong feeling that He’s not
here.”
“Where else would He be? He wouldn’t wander off into Jerusalem
by Himself.”
“Don’t you think we should look for Him?”
“We’re already moving. We can’t stop the whole caravan now. He
has to be with the caravan somewhere. Don’t worry. Have faith. Why
don’t you go ride with the children? You shouldn’t overexert yourself.”
“I just—”
“Don’t worry. We’ll find Him.”
***
Jesus had a peaceful morning in the temple, praying by Himself
in a secluded spot. Elric basked in the sweet aroma of the Spirit that he
always enjoyed when in the inner court of the King’s Realm. I wonder

415

if Jesus can smell it. Most humans couldn’t. I wonder if any enemy forces
can smell it. He scanned the outer courtyard. None seemed to notice.
Jenli alighted next to Elric and reported, “Captain, the caravan
has left. Neither Joseph nor Mary responds to our leading. Initially,
they were separated and thought Jesus was with the other. But we
were able to bring them together. They realized too late that Jesus is
not with either of them, but now they are trusting He is among their
relatives. They will likely not know He has been left behind until they
make camp tonight.”
“This is an interesting turn of events. We certainly did not
foresee this.” Elric rubbed his chin. “I suppose He just needed more
time here at the temple.”
Elric looked up and waited. He closed his eyes and waited.
Opening his eyes, he said, “Here is the plan. You and Zaben stay with
the caravan and keep trying to reach Joseph and Mary. In the best
case, you could have them break away from the caravan and be back
here in an hour. In the worst case, they will realize He isn’t with the
caravan tonight when they make camp. They will have a full day of
travel back, but they could be here tomorrow night. Send the rest of
your teams back here to provide cover in the temple. Perhaps, Jesus
will just stay there. If He strikes out toward camp and realizes He has
been left behind, we will deal with that if the time comes.”
***
By midmorning on the day after the Passover festival, the
regular routine of temple activities marched on, although with a less
hectic pace with all the Passover pilgrims on their way home. An

416

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

aged rabbi with a long wiry white beard and high cheekbones set up
for the morning lesson under the shade of Solomon’s Portico. Years
of wisdom carved age lines into his face, but his eyes still sparkled
with the energy of a young man. Word had gotten around among the
priests about a young boy who had been asking many deep questions
and displaying unusual knowledge of Scriptures. This elder rabbi
volunteered to take the day’s lesson in hopes of seeing what everyone
had been talking about. Several other rabbis stood by with hopes of
the same.
By the time Jesus left His solitary corner and joined the class,
the lesson had already begun. He approached the gathering, and the
rabbis in the wings whispered and pointed to each other. Jesus sat
in the middle of eight boys, a much smaller class than it had been
all week. The day’s lesson centered on the promised Messiah, and
the teacher had already established from Scriptures that the Messiah
would come from the line of King David and would sit on the throne
over all Israel. Jesus entered the lesson while the rabbi showed that the
Messiah would conquer all of Israel’s foes and sit as the great Judge by
reading from the book of Isaiah.
“‘And behold, the day of the Lord is coming, cruel, with fury and
burning anger, to make the land a desolation; and He will exterminate
its sinners from it. For the stars of heaven and their constellations will
not flash forth their light; the sun will be dark when it rises, and the
moon will not shed its light. Thus I will punish the world for its
evil and the wicked for their iniquity. I will also put an end to the
arrogance of the proud and abase the haughtiness of the ruthless. I
will make mortal man scarcer than pure gold and mankind than the
gold of Ophir. Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the

THE TEST

417

earth will be shaken from its place at the fury of the Lord of hosts in
the day of His burning anger.’”
Jesus shot up His hand. The rabbis off to the side whispered to
themselves. The teacher handed the book to an attendant, looked
up, and noticed Jesus for the first time. He glanced over to his
companions, who gave him an affirmative head nod.
“Yes, young man, you have a question?”
Jesus sat up straight and spoke clear and loud. “How do you
explain the apparent inconsistencies in the role of the coming Messiah?
In Isaiah it also says, ‘The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because
the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the afflicted; He has
sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to captives
and freedom to prisoners; to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.’
These two passages seem to describe the Messiah very differently.”
The rabbis on the side elbowed each other.
“You are insightful for a boy your age,” said the teacher, shooting
a glance at the other rabbis.
He turned back to the class and raised his chin. “That is the
thing about prophecy, isn’t it? We do our best to understand it, but we
often do not fully comprehend it all until we look back on the events
and examine it in retrospect. This is one of those difficult cases, and
there are at least two interpretations. One possible explanation is that
there are actually two Messiahs. One will be the conquering savior
and judge, while the other one will be the kind and compassionate
shepherd of Israel who will lead us into peace and joy. There are many
respected rabbis who hold to this view. Another explanation is that
one Messiah will accomplish both. First, He will vanquish our foes
and punish the wicked. Then He will heal His people and ‘bind up

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

418

the brokenhearted.’ Personally, I think there is only one Messiah. The
passage you quoted from Isaiah even illustrates this because right after
it says, ‘to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord,’ it continues by
saying, ‘And to proclaim the day of vengeance of our God.’ Since it is
clearly the same Messiah in a single passage, I believe this means that
a single Messiah will accomplish both. So, tell me young man, what
do you think?”
Jesus paused for a moment, then replied, “I think there is more
about this that needs to be understood.”
“Well said,” the rabbi said, nodding. “Very well said.”
***
From his regular position in front of Solomon’s Portico, Elric
looked up at the sun, which stood high overhead. He looked back
at Jesus, engrossed in some discussion with the rabbis. He caught
Timrok’s attention and motioned for him. Timrok made his way over.
“We need to feed Him,” Elric said.
“Yes, Captain. I will see to it.”
Timrok weaved through the bustling crowd and evaluated
different vendors as though trying to pick someone on which to
bestow some great honor. He stopped at one, bent over, and spoke to
him. With one wing he covered their two heads. Timrok straightened
and waited. He bent over and spoke to the man again. He waited
some more. Timrok moved on. He tried another man. No response.
He tried another. Again, no response. He spoke to a fourth vendor.
The vendor collected up some things into baskets and covered his
stand with a blanket. Timrok looked over at Elric from across the
courtyard, smiled, and gave a head nod.

THE TEST

419

The rabbi fi nished some important point in his lesson and
reached for another scroll.
The vendor approached the class, his arms full of two woven
baskets, a square one filled with fresh matzo bread and a large round
one filled with dates and figs. “Excuse me, rabbi,” he said. “I am sorry
to interrupt.”
“Yes, what is it?”
“I was just sitting at my table when it occurred to me that these
fine boys have been sitting here studying with you all morning, and
they must be getting hungry.”
“This is not the time or place for that,” the rabbi gruffed. “Go
sell your wares in the courtyard like everyone else.”
The other rabbis moved toward the vendor.
“No, no, no, no,” the man said. “These are a gift. I thought about
all the other boys who are out running in the streets and playing
while these young men have chosen a more noble way to spend their
day. I want them to have this. It is a gift.”
The rabbi smiled and bowed his head. “In that case, thank you
very much for your kindness. May the Lord bless you.”
“Thank you, sir. And may the Lord bless you,” the man said. He
backed away with a bowed head.
“Well, boys,” the rabbi said, “it appears that it is time to break
for lunch. Pass these baskets around and help yourself.”
***
That night, Elric and his lieutenants gathered around Jesus, who
had curled up against the wall in the outer court of the temple. Sparse

torches on sconces cast a warm glow on the main court areas, but
most of the court lay buried in night shadows.
“Is He just going to sleep there?” Jenli asked.
“He came here to pray,” Elric said, “and sleep overtook Him. I
don’t think He intended to stay.”
“Now what do we do?” Timrok said.
“We watch over Him tonight, and we watch over Him tomorrow,”
Elric said. “Do Joseph and Mary know He is missing yet?”
“Yes,” Jenli said. “They begin the trip back here tomorrow
morning. They are very upset.”
Zaben knelt down next to Jesus and watched Him breathing.
Zaben looked up at Lacidar and asked, “The prophet John is still in
Jerusalem?”
“Yes,” Lacidar said, “he spent the day in the Court of Women
like he has all week. He will be there again tomorrow.”
Zaben stood up and smiled at Elric.
“What are you thinking?” Elric asked.
“This is His test. Did you hear anything the Father said to the
Son today?”
“No.”
Zaben bit his lip and paced tiny steps. “I believe He knows the
course the Father has set before Him. The question is, will He step
into that course?”
Elric paused for a moment. He said, “No, I do not agree—not
completely. I agree that He must know His course by now. However,
I believe there is no question as to whether He will follow it. The real
question is, what is that course? This we still do not know.”

421

“Don’t forget,” Zaben said, “He has the flesh of man. There is a
choice He must make.”
Elric put his hand on Zaben’s shoulder. “Yes, you are right about
that.” Elric looked down at Jesus and smiled. “The good news is, we
will know this matter tomorrow—or possibly the day after. The time
is close.”

body—without Daniel’s conscious will—in the Court of
Women, where he had observed a most interesting boy for the

last four days. He stayed in the shadows, but he drew close enough to
hear the discussions of the class.

What is it about this boy?
He had learned that the boy’s name was John, but he still knew
too little about him.
I am convinced he is not the King. But I think he may be the prophet
who precedes the King.

He paced like a hungry wolf, looking back over his shoulder at
John each time he turned away.
I need proof. Give me something.
***
The second night after Passover, four elzur lieutenants and a
captain gathered beside the twelve–year–old Jesus, who had fallen
asleep while praying in a secluded spot in the outer court of the
temple grounds.
“What is the status of Joseph and Mary?” Elric asked.
“They are back in Jerusalem,” Zaben answered.
Jenli said, “We tried to bring them directly back here to the
temple, but they would not hear us. They are too upset. They went
immediately to the local authorities, convinced He would be there.
Then they just started searching the streets.”
“Tomorrow morning they plan to search the marketplace,”
Zaben said.
“Get them here as quickly as you can,” Elric said.
Zaben and Jenli nodded.
“What happened here in the temple today?” Zaben asked Elric.
“It was a very interesting day, indeed.” Elric knelt down on one
knee as though he wanted to share a secret. The others knelt down
with him.
“Today, I stayed with the class and listened to Jesus interact with
the rabbis. I wish I had been doing that all week.”
“Why? What did He say?” All four lieutenants’ eyes glimmered.

“He spent most of the day challenging all the extra rabbinical
laws, traditions, and rituals that have been added since Moses.”
“He challenged the elder rabbis?”
“He did not challenge them directly, but He did make them
try to explain why all the extra laws were necessary and if they truly
served any spiritual purpose.”
Timrok stood up and put his hand on his sword. “That sounds
to me like a King about to set His house in order.”
“It does,” said Jenli.
Zaben bit his lower lip and smiled.
Elric stood up. “Tomorrow we shall see.”

Baptism minus 18 years, Day 3 after Passover
Almost midday, on the third day after Passover, Zaben and Jenli
entered the outer temple court and marched directly up to Elric and
Timrok, who stood guard under the portico near a class already in
session. Jesus sat in the middle of the class. An elder rabbi led the
discussion with a dozen other teachers standing by.
“Captain,” Zaben said to Elric, “it took us all morning, but
Joseph and Mary are finally here.”
Joseph and Mary came through the gate looking frazzled and
tired.
“Very good,” Elric said. “Now we shall see what the King will
do.”
All the angelic team shared excited smiles and rested their hands
on their sword hilts.

Joseph spotted Jesus. “There he is!” he said, pointing to the small
group gathered beneath Solomon’s Portico.
“Jesus!” Mary squealed. She ran toward him and screamed,
“Jesus!”
Joseph followed a step behind. Mary reached the edge of the
class with her arm outstretched to Jesus.
Joseph approached the rabbi, bowed his head low, and said,
“Master rabbi, I am sorry. Please pardon the interruption.”
The rabbi nodded once. Mary grabbed Jesus’ hand, and Joseph
backed away with his head still bowed. Off to the side, away from the
class, Mary clung to Jesus with both arms and sobbed uncontrollably.
She sobbed for a long time, holding Him tight. Joseph stood
behind her with his hand on her shoulder. Finally, she regained her
composure. She loosened her grip enough to look into His face, but
kept her hands locked on His shoulders.
Through broken sobs she said, “Son, why have you treated us
this way? Your father and I have been anxiously looking for you.”
Jesus looked almost confused by all the dramatics. With a calm
voice He answered, “Why is it that you were looking for Me? Did you
not know that I had to be in My Father’s house?”
“Why were we looking for . . . ” Mary took an exasperated
breath. “We left for home three days ago! We thought you were lost.
Or taken. Or who knows what? I don’t understand what you were
thinking.”
“Come,” said Joseph. His voice sounded calm and practical.
“There is still time to eat, refresh our provisions, and get in a half a
day of travel. We will never catch the caravan, but our relatives are

watching after your brothers and sister, and we need to get back to

“Here it is,” Elric said with a tight throat. “What is He going to
do?”
***
In the inner Women’s Court, Vorsogh peered through Daniel’s
eyes at the boy named John, sitting in the middle of the late–
morning lesson. The boy’s father, Zacharias, stood next to another
priest behind Elizabeth’s seat, and Vorsogh pressed against the wall
in the shadows behind them. Elizabeth and Zacharias smiled at the
interaction between the rabbi and the young students. The priest
beside Zacharias remained stoic and pious. Vorsogh, using Daniel’s
body, put on a look of disinterest and turned away with short jerky
movements whenever someone looked his direction.
John answered a question from the rabbi leader, and Zacharias
beamed. Zacharias crossed his hands behind his back and leaned
sideways. He whispered to the other priest, “That’s my boy.”
“Mmm,” said the priest. “Smart boy. You must be very proud.”
He eyed Zacharias and Elizabeth and raised his eyebrows. “That’s your
boy? A man your age with a son in his youth?”
Zacharias puffed out his chest. “He is our miracle child. My wife
was barren, but the Lord opened her womb in our old age. Everything
happened exactly as the angel told us it would.”
“An angel told you that you would have a child?”
Vorsogh’s ears perked up. An angel?

SUBMISSION

427

“Oh, yes,” Zacharias said, “while I was serving in the temple, an
angel named Gabriel told me we would have a son.”
Vorsogh twitched. Gabriel!
“You saw the angel?” the priest asked.
“Yes, yes, of course.”
“Did the angel tell you anything else?”
Zacharias lowered his voice. “I don’t like to tell many people
this.” Zacharias looked around.
Vorsogh turned his head away.
“The angel said his name was to be John, and that he would be
the prophet that goes before the coming Messiah.”
“Is that so?” the priest said with an incredulous tone.
“I knew it!” Vorsogh shouted with Daniel’s voice.
Vorsogh, still inside Daniel’s body, jumped out of the shadows
and made a move toward John. In an instant, another demon jumped
from the shadows onto Vorsogh’s back. The attacking demon had a
small, gaunt stature, bulging eyes, and one stray fang that wouldn’t
stay behind his lip.
“What are you doing?” Vorsogh screeched.
“Leave the boy alone!” the small demon said, clawing at Vorsogh
within Daniel’s body.
Vorsogh reeled around, but he couldn’t free himself. This human
flesh—too constraining—I can’t . . .
Vorsogh leapt out of Daniel’s body, grabbed his attacker by the
neck, and smashed him to the ground.
In the Physical Realm, the class came to a halt when a strange
young man jumped from the shadows and started flailing his arms

and spinning around. Then he fell unconscious, face first on the
ground. Nearby priests rushed over and knelt over him.
Vorsogh growled and said, “Who are you?”
“I am Tumur, and you can’t have this boy,” Tumur said with a
voice low and defiant.
Vorsogh picked Tumur up over his head and threw him across
the court. Tumur tumbled to a stop, got up, and melted away into
the crowd. Vorsogh spun around. Grr. Now I’ve lost the advantage of
surprise.
An elzur lieutenant stood between him and John. Two more
elzur warriors approached fast.
Outnumbered and out of time.
In rapid succession he shouted words into his hands. “Blindness!
Leprosy! Lesions! Cancer! Heart disease! Sickness! Epilepsy! Sickness!”
With each word, a small fireball formed, and he hurled them
toward John with both hands. Two dozen flaming missiles blasted
through the spiritual air in a relentless stream. The angel lieutenant
braced and held up a round shield with the figure of an ox in front
of the fiery barrage. Most of the plasma balls bounced off in all
directions. Some of them were absorbed by the shield. None of them
appeared to hit John.
Vorsogh glanced left and then right. The two warriors in white
approached fast, almost a blade’s distance away. He reached for his
own sword. “You insignificant slaves are no match for me. I’ll crush
you beneath my—”
Sizzling heat split through the top of his skull. The front end of
a blade sliced downward between his eyes, and paralyzing pain shot
down through his whole body. Everything went black.

He opened his eyes. An elzur lieutenant stood over him with his
foot on his chest. Vorsogh wrenched upward, but he couldn’t move.
White cords of energy bound him head to foot.
“Remove him from here,” the lieutenant said. The lieutenant
called up to the senturim standing guard at the corner of the temple,
“This one shall not enter here again.”
Vorsogh thrashed against the bindings, but they held strong. He
gave up and let his head fall limp. The angels hoisted him up by the
bindings and lifted off.
***
Elric held his breath, waiting for Jesus’ next move. Will He go
with Joseph and Mary? Will He stay in the temple? Will He announce the
beginning of His campaign? Will John come over and anoint Him King?
Lacidar alighted next to Elric. Lacidar still held his weapon out,
and his shield glowed from some residual heat.
“Captain,” Lacidar said. “There has been an attack on John. It
was a single attacker, and he has been subdued.”
“How is John?” Elric asked.
“He is unharmed. But . . . ” Lacidar’s arm with his shield fell
down to his side.
“What?”
“Many fiery darts hit others.”
“Zacharias and Elizabeth?”
“They were both hit. We do not know if anything reached their
spirits.”
“Their spiritual armor is strong. I trust they will be—wait. Jesus
is about to answer His test.”

Jesus looked around at the temple. His eyes passed by all the
majestic columns. He gazed past the tall wall of the inner court and
fixated on the sacred inner temple edifice that housed the Holy of
Holies. Elric could see it in His eyes—the yearning to be reunited with
His Father, while the walls of stone, flesh, and time stood between.
Jesus hesitated for another moment. He looked back at Joseph.
“Yes, sir,” He said. He picked up Mary’s traveling sack.
“That’s it?” Zaben said.
Elric laughed. “It is not His time. This was His test—would He
submit to His human parents and wait for His appointed time? He
has to go with them to fulfill the law to honor His father and mother.”
“No, this has to be His time,” Zaben said. “Go get John. Hurry,
it’s not too late.”
Elric put his hand on Zaben’s shoulder. “We need to move.
Now.” To Lacidar he said, “See to John.” To the other lieutenants he
said, “Deploy your teams for travel.”
“In His service.”
“We will regroup after we get Him back to Nazareth.”
Something across the far side of the outer court caught Elric’s
attention—two priests carrying an unconscious young man on a cot
from the Court of Women.

Shelves along all the walls held vials and clay pitchers and small
wooden boxes. A man sat at a table reading parchments.
“Where am I?” Daniel asked.
“Oh, you’re awake,” the man said. “We were very concerned.”
“What is this place?”
“This is the temple infirmary.”
“How did I get here?”
“You passed out in the inner temple court.”
“How long have I been—”
“Since yesterday afternoon.”
“I have to go,” Daniel said. He jumped to his feet and moved
toward the door.
The man stood up from his chair. “Wait! You can’t just—”
Before the man could stop him, Daniel escaped through the
door and ran. He passed through the temple gate without looking
back and ran all the way down the steps from the temple mount. He
darted around people in the street and didn’t stop until he reached the
city gate. He paused and turned back to make sure no one followed.
Then he stepped outside the city wall and started toward his hideout.
“Levi? Are you there?” he said, still panting from his run. “I don’t
sense you at all. Where are you?”
He reached his camp, and he rooted through all his piles to make
sure everything was still there. Then he sat with his head between his
knees and rocked back and forth for a long time.
“Levi, where are you? I’m so scared. What am I supposed to do?”
He curled up in a ball and fell asleep.
The next morning, he awoke with a start—like all the air had
just been sucked out of his body. Terror flashed into his empty soul.
He jerked upright to a sitting position and screamed.

Elric, Timrok, Lacidar, and Zaben gathered around the war map
at Hannah’s house on the night after returning Jesus to Nazareth.
Everyone stood in silence, peering off into the map—or through
it. Elric crossed his arms and took a deep breath. He held it, then
slowly released it with a tight jaw. His left eye twitched twice—the
involuntary tick from a distant, secret pain. He glanced around at the
lieutenants. They didn’t seem to notice.
Jenli popped in through the ceiling, and everyone’s attention
turned to him. His wings folded away as his feet touched the ground.
He held a parchment in his hand.
“What did you find?” Elric asked.
Jenli unrolled the scroll for everyone to see. “Every one of these
twelve are too young to be generals today. A few of them are yet to
be born. Timrok, these are the same Simon and Andrew you rescued
during the days of Herod. Their family moved to Galilee, and their
father is now a fisherman. Zaben, this is the Judas you rescued during

“This means we still have years to wait,” Zaben said. “Probably
until He is thirty.”
Elric turned back to the map, crossed his arms again, and took
another breath.
“A mere blink in the face of eternity,” Lacidar said.
Elric nodded. Again, silence overtook the group.
Without taking his eyes off the map, Elric said, “The King gave
us these twelve names for a reason. They are not ready to be generals
in the King’s army today, so we must help prepare them. It appears
we have time.”
He turned toward the lieutenants.
“Zaben and Jenli, with you and your two teams, we have twelve
warriors. Each of you twelve will take as a charge one of these men. If
they are not born yet, watch over their family until they are. I leave it
to you to make the individual assignments.”
“Sir,” Zaben said, “What of the defenses in Nazareth?”
“Timrok’s team will maintain our inner line of defense. For
our outer perimeter, we shall reduce our number to five. Establish a
rotation of your two teams—part time with the twelve, part time in
Nazareth. When we travel to Jerusalem for the Passover feasts each
year, we will all go.”
Jenli pulled a ledger from his cloak and started writing on it.
“Yes, sir,” he said.
Elric turned back toward the war map. Zaben held the scroll
with the twelve names out at arm’s length next to Jenli, and the two
made assignments.

Several moments later, Grigor flashed through the roof like a
whisper and landed in the middle of the map.
“The word of the Lord,” he said.
Elric made the map disappear with a wave of his hand.
“The Son has committed Himself to His earthly family,” Grigor
said, “and the Father is well pleased. The Son will complete His full
days there to honor His mother and support His family. It is almost
time to prepare John to receive the word of the Lord. The enemy has
dealt a fatal blow to Zacharias and Elizabeth in the temple. Soon
their flesh will manifest the wounds received through their spirit.
After their passing, you must move John to the wilderness, where
he will remain until his days of preparation are complete. After this,
the prophet’s voice will be heard throughout the land. The Son will
come to the prophet to fulfill all righteousness. And then . . . ” Grigor
paused and held back a smile, “Then the King will be revealed.”
Elric bowed his head once and said, “In His service.”
“By His word,” Grigor replied. In a flash, the messenger
disappeared.
Elric turned around to the lieutenants and said, “There is the
word we were waiting for. We have our assignment and . . . where is
Lacidar?”
Lacidar appeared through the roof behind them and said, “I am
here.” He pulled his resonar out from behind his back and strummed
a chord.
“I don’t care if we have to wait a hundred more years before the
King is revealed. He is going to be revealed, and we are partakers of
His great plan. Patient endurance honors the King. And I, for one,
am excited to bring Him this honor.”

He strummed his instrument again. Then his fingers went wild
over the strings. Timrok leapt into the air, spun three tight circles, and
came down dancing, drawing Jenli and Zaben in with him. Lacidar
sang his song again while Elric directed.
“The King is here! The King is here!
Victory, victory, the King is here!
His enemies are scattered, the evil days are shattered,
Victory, victory, the King is here!”

he following year, on the trip home from the Passover festival,
Raziel traveled with Joseph near the middle of the caravan. Jesus
led the donkey cart, and His younger brothers James and Joseph

bounced around in the cart and climbed all over the packs and boxes.
Joseph and Raziel plodded behind the cart.

“How old are you now, James?” Raziel called out above the noise
of the wheels.
“Eight and a half,” James said, draping his arms over the rail.
“I’m seven,” little Joseph shouted, jumping up and down. His
eyes barely cleared the rail with each jump.

“You boys are getting big,” Raziel said. “You did a good job this
week. I’m sure your father is proud. Do you miss your ima?”
“Yes, I suppose so,” James said. The two boys spun around and
climbed up a pile of packs.
Raziel turned to Joseph walking beside him. “I know it had to be
hard for Mary to miss the trip this year.”
“It was,” Joseph said, “but it was too much with little Jude.
Traveling with a three-month-old.”
Raziel laughed. “Say no more.”
“Elizabeth is only five,” Joseph said, “but she’s a big help with
Simon and Jude. So, Mary wasn’t completely alone.”
“They are beautiful children, all six. You have quite a family.”
“Thank you. Tell me, how did Jesus do in the temple this year?”
“Well, He decided to travel home with the caravan this year.”
“Uhhgh, don’t remind me of that.”
Raziel laughed and slapped Joseph on the back. A cloud of dust
rose from his tunic.
“He was different this year,” Raziel said.
“How so?”
“Last year, He seemed like He was ready to take on the world.
And I thought He just might. He challenged the leaders with very
provocative questions. He displayed wisdom far beyond that which
He has learned from me. There were times when I wondered . . . ”
“What?”
“Nothing. I just get excited sometimes. But this year—this year
He spoke up very little. And He wanted to spend most of His time in
the inner courts, praying and listening to the singing.”

They walked without talking. Both watched Jesus in front of the
cart, leading the donkey.
“It’s different for Him,” Raziel said, “The temple. For me, I
always feel like a visitor there. For Him it’s like—”
“Home,” Joseph said.
“Yes, like home.”

Daniel watched some men coming in off the Sea of Galilee just
south of Capernaum. They unloaded their catch of fish into large
baskets and hoisted them onto carts. Daniel stayed hidden at a safe
distance.
“It would be easier to just steal what we need,” said the voice in
Daniel’s ear.
“I know,” Daniel said, “but our money is gone, and I’m tired of
stealing and running from town to town.”
“Better still, we could kill these men and take their whole load to
market and sell it ourselves.”
Daniel pulled his knife from his belt and fingered its sharp edge.
He stared at the men. He gazed out across the lake.
“No,” he said. “It’s not just about the money. I want out on the
water. We will do it my way.”
He put the knife away and walked toward the fishermen. Hatred
rose from within him with each step, but he did his best to hide it and
put on a pleasant face.
“Good morning,” Daniel called out to the fishermen.

LIFE MOVES ON

439

“Morning,” and “Shalom,” came the polite but short replies of
the men. They continued their work.
“Just kill them,” the voice in Daniel’s ear said.
Daniel scowled and shook his head. He put his innocent face
back on and said, “Do you have any need for an extra hand? I am new
in town and looking for work.”
“Sorry,” replied the most senior of the three.
His skin looked weathered and leathery, and Daniel could tell
this man had layers of wisdom from the sea. Daniel couldn’t help but
respect the man. He envied him. He hated him.
“We are a small operation,” the man said, “and I have all the help
I can use.” He lifted a full basket of fish onto a cart with the other full
baskets of fish. “You might want to check with a man named Zebedee
a little farther up the lake. I don’t know if he is hiring right now, but
I do know he has paid crew members.”
“Thank you,” Daniel said. He passed by the men and continued
along the shoreline.
A mile later, Daniel came upon a cluster of several boats with
at least a dozen men loading fish, hauling nets, and tending sails.
Seagulls squawked and filled the shoreline air with motion. Daniel
approached this work crew like he had the last, with a cheerful and
innocent look.
“Good morning, I am looking for a man named Zebedee. Are
these his boats?”
One of the men stopped and pointed toward a man who stood
on the back of a cart receiving a basket of fish from one of the
crewmembers. “Yes, that is Zebedee on the cart.”
“Thank you.”

“Sir,” Daniel said, approaching the cart. “I am new in town and
looking for work. Could you use an extra hand?”
“Well, I don’t know—possibly,” Zebedee replied. “Where are
you from, son?”
“Just outside of Nazareth,” Daniel said.
“I am from Nazareth originally. Do I know you?”
“I don’t think so.”
Zebedee looked down from the back of the cart, and Daniel
could feel his gaze burn straight through him.
Does he know me? Has he heard about me? Does he know my family?
Daniel looked down at his feet and fought back the urge to run.
“Tell me, what brings you all the way up here to Capernaum?”
Zebedee asked.
“I have always wanted to be a fisherman. I love the sea.
Capernaum seems like a good place.”
Zebedee continued to eye him without saying anything. Daniel
shuffled his feet and fidgeted with his hair.
“I have had a rough year, sir,” Daniel said. “I am hungry, and I
could use a job. Please, I will work hard for you, and I want to learn.”
Zebedee raised his hand. “Very well, son, I will give you a chance.
You can start right now. We have to get this fish to market while it’s
fresh. What did you say your name was?”
I can’t tell him my real name. If he does know my family, he’ll . . .
“Levi,” Daniel blurted out. His voice had a deeper and raspier
tone than normal, and the sound of it startled himself. He reached his
hand up to his throat, but just scratched an imaginary itch. Zebedee
didn’t seem to notice.

“Well, then, Levi, you can start by hauling those baskets of fish
from the boats over there to the cart here.”
“Yes, sir.”
Daniel ran across the shore toward the boats.
“You told him my name was Levi,” Daniel whispered as he ran.
“You had to answer something,” the voice said.
“Now I am you, and you’re me?”
“We have always been one.”
Daniel strained to lift a full basket of fish. Through gritted teeth
Daniel said, “Just don’t ruin this for us. I have a job now. Maybe now
we can live without stealing. Maybe now we can stay in one place.”
***

Daniel collapsed onto his makeshift bed mat at the end of a dark
alley in Capernaum.
“That was a hard shift last night,” he said to Levi. “I’m exhausted.”
“Six months of this. I don’t know why we do it,” the voice in his
ear said. “It was easier when we just stole what we needed.”
“Because I love it. I love being out on the water. I always wanted
to be a fisherman. And now I have some real skills. And now I don’t
go to sleep hungry. And I have some change in my pouch.”
“I hate the crew.”
“Me too.”
“We should kill them and take over the boats.”
“No! Why do you always want to kill everyone? I need them. I
need this job.”

“You know you want to hurt them. You like the power. Every
time we fight with someone, and I help you—you feel the power. You
like it. You want more.”
“Stop it! Just stop it!” Daniel shouted.
He reached for a full skin of wine, pulled its stopper, sat up, and
swallowed several large gulps.
“A girl then,” the voice said. “We could go find a young girl
and—”
Daniel jumped to his feet and pounded on his forehead with his
fist. “Stop it, Levi! I just want to sleep.” He drank some more wine.
“I just need quiet.”
He ran out of the alley and turned down another, smashing his
shoulder against the building to redirect his momentum. Stumbling
forward, he turned again. He stopped long enough to guzzle some
more wine. He ran again with aimless abandon.
“I just need quiet,” he muttered. “I just need quiet.”
He turned another corner, and there down the street stood the
town synagogue. He shuddered. He took another drink, wiped his
mouth with his sleeve, and stared at it.
Tall and impressive, its white limestone walls stood out in stark
contrast with the gray basalt buildings of the town. The foundation of
massive limestone blocks rose the full height of a man, and the front
porch on the south side had smooth limestone steps leading up on
each side. The inane emblems of the misguided religious—menorahs,
ram’s horns, incense shovels, palm fronds, clusters of grapes and
pomegranates, and geometric shapes—adorned the limestone reliefs
on the capitols.

443

For no rational reason at all, he staggered forward until he
reached the synagogue. He leaned one hand against the side wall and
slid along it until he reached rear of the building. He leaned his back
against the wall and sank down to the ground. He took another drink.
“Levi? Are you there?” he said.
He heard no reply. He took another drink.
“Levi?”
His brain became numb from the wine, and Levi had become
quiet. It felt like a dark curtain had been lowered between him and
his darkness.
He closed his eyes and went to sleep.

Five grim elzur faces surveyed the war map at Hannah’s house.
“It is clear we are on the brink,” Elric said.
Elric crossed his arms and looked into the faces of his lieutenants.
Zaben had a distant gaze and bit his lip. Lacidar’s eyes welled up with
tears. Timrok looked stern and never took his hands off his sword
handles. Jenli wept silently with his eyes closed.
“I expect John’s trials will begin within the year,” Elric said.
“It grieves the King,” Jenli said without opening his eyes. “I sense
John’s pain in the King’s heart. There is joy—and passion—beyond
the pain. But right now, there is pain.” Jenli wiped his eyes.
Elric grimaced. “The enemy is ruthless. There are so many
casualties. There is so much pain in the walk through the battlefield.”
“But the wilderness . . . at his age,” Lacidar said.

“It is best,” Zaben said. “We will be better able to protect him

Elric’s left eye twitched twice. “True. The encounter in the
temple two years ago was . . . unfortunate. As always, we will turn
what the enemy intended for harm into something good.” He put his
hand on Lacidar’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze.
Lacidar lifted his head and blinked the tears out onto his cheek.
“There is joy beyond the wilderness.” He took a deep breath and let
it out. “If it takes a hundred years, it is worth it to receive the word
of the Lord.”
“A voice of one calling in the wilderness,” Zaben said.
“And then,” Timrok said, “the revelation of the King.”
Elric squeezed Lacidar’s shoulder again and smiled. “You will
be happy to know that Mary just had her baby. They named her
Rachael, after their relative in Egypt. She is beautiful.”
Lacidar smiled. “Seven children. Your house is noisier than

Elric laughed. “And I love every moment.”

n the bedroom of Zacharias, John peeled a damp towel off
Elizabeth’s forehead. He felt her forehead with his hand,
shook his head, and folded a new cool towel over it. Her

body had been failing for a year now, but over the last month, she had
taken a dramatic turn for the worse. She suffered constant pain, and
the doctors didn’t know what to do for her. She had been bed-ridden
for over a week, and today her condition grew even worse. Her shallow,
inconsistent breaths brought her in and out of consciousness. Once in a
while, she became lucid enough to give John a weak smile and squeeze
his hand.
445

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

446

John looked around the empty room and glanced toward the
front door.
“Come on, Father,” he mumbled. “Why aren’t you home yet?”
I can’t do this alone. I don’t know what to do.
He dabbed Elizabeth’s forehead again. “Hang on, Ima. Father
will be home soon.”
The morning dragged by. Cool towel after towel couldn’t bring
the fever down. Finally, Zacharias came through the front door just
after midday. John let out an audible sigh of relief.
Zacharias held his hand over a basin and poured water over it
with a pitcher. “How is she doing?” Zacharias asked. He washed his
other hand.
“Not good at all. She’s not even conscious most of the time.”
“That is probably for the best.”
“And her fever has gotten worse. She isn’t going to make it, is
she?”
His own words echoed off the walls and pierced his heart. He
dropped down into the chair next to the bed. He broke down. All
the tension and grief erupted in a flood of tears, and he fought for air
between deep, uncontrollable sobs.
Zacharias shuffled over to John and stroked his long hair—the
hair that had never been cut, the hair of the promised prophet. “John,
don’t be sad. Your mother and I . . . we are old and spent. But we have
had a full and blessed life. The Lord has given us so much. He gave us
you. And we have seen the Messiah. And that is more than we could
have ever dreamed of.”
John looked up at Zacharias through his tears.

INTO THE WILDERNESS

447

Zacharias’s eyes welled up. He sat down beside John, and the
two cried together.
After a long time, when he had no more tears left, John wiped
his face with a towel, sat up straight, and took a deep breath. “What
was the big meeting about at the synagogue?” John asked.
“Oh, nothing that is worth talking about right now,” Zacharias
said. He reached over, changed Elizabeth’s towel, and stroked the
brittle skin on her gaunt arm.
“What? What is it?” John said.
“Now is not the time.”
“Father, you have to tell me. Is something wrong?”
“Well, they decided . . . ” Zacharias buried his face in his hands.
“What? They decided what?”
“I have been cut off from the priesthood. I am no longer—”
“What? Why?”
Zacharias shrugged.
“So, what does this mean?”
“Well, for one thing, they will be coming to take our house
soon.”
John stood up. “They can do that?”
“I am afraid so. Remember, we are Levites and we do not own
this property.”
“But aren’t these supposed to be men of God?”
“Beware, John. Beware of the hard–hearted religious. Do not
look at the outward appearances of men. It is what is in the heart that
matters.”
Elizabeth coughed—one weak, shallow cough. She coughed
again. She coughed three times. She started a nonstop string of coughs

448

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

that convulsed her whole body. Zacharias dabbed her forehead and
face with the towel. She stopped for a moment. She coughed twice
more, spraying a fine mist of blood. She became quiet. John held his
breath. She didn’t move. Her chest didn’t rise and fall.
“No!” John shouted, moving toward her. “Mother! Mother!”
“John, no,” Zacharias said. “You can’t touch her. Remember
your Nazirite vow.”
John backed away and shoved his hands under his armpits.
“Oh, Elizabeth,” Zacharias moaned, dabbing the blood off her
face with a towel and a trembling hand. “My bride. The love of my
life.”
He wiped his stream of tears on his shoulder and went back to
dabbing Elizabeth’s face.
“I love you so much.”
The old man grabbed his chest. He jerked and slumped over
where he sat.
“Father, what is it? What’s the matter?” John said.
“I don’t . . . know. Can’t . . . breathe. My heart . . . ”
“It’s okay. It’s okay, just breathe. It will be okay.”
“John?”
“I am here, Father.”
“John, you . . . are . . . the prophet. John?”
“Father.”
“You . . . are . . . ”
Zacharias drooped over sideways and landed half-curled-up next
to Elizabeth.
John moved toward his father but pulled up short and wedged
his hands under his armpits. A shockwave shot through his brain and
left him motionless and numb.

449

Both parents—lifeless and empty.
John stared at them. His mouth hung open. I can’t believe this . . .
A pot of anger boiled up within his belly. It rose into his chest,
and the heat burned inside his cheeks. His throbbing pulse pounded
in his temples. He ran circles around the small house, knocking things
off the table and screaming.
“No! No! Why?”
He threw over the chairs.
“Why are you doing this to me, God?”
He pulled at his hair.
He looked at the lifeless body of Zacharias. “It was all too much
for him,” he shouted. “It’s their fault!”
He crashed out of the house and lumbered toward town, fighting
through the steady river of tears. He reached town and went straight
to the synagogue. He burst through the heavy ornate wooden doors.
Inside, the atmosphere felt slow and reverent with quiet incense
hanging below the tranquil rafters. Five priests in elaborate robes
stood together near the front sipping from silver goblets.
“You killed him!” John’s booming words echoed through the
cavernous quiet.
“Is that Zacharias’s boy?” one of the priests said to the others.
“What is the matter, son?”
“I am not your son, you brood of vipers.”
“Calm down, young man, and tell us what is troubling you.”
“My mother is dead, and now, because of you, my father is gone,
too.”
“I assure you, we have no idea what you are—”
“You killed him! It’s your fault. His blood is on your hands.”

John turned, bolted out the door, and ran all the way home.
Back at home, John circled around the room like a cornered wild
animal.
What am I going to do now? I can’t bury them. I can’t even touch
them.
He looked at them with his hands under his armpits. After
several more minutes of staring at them through a wall of tears, he
took a blanket and covered them, being careful not to touch them or
the bed.
Something deep within his spirit stirred. The men from the
synagogue would be showing up any minute to see about his tirade in
the synagogue. He had to get out before they got there. They would
be taking the house. Who knows, maybe they would take him. He
needed to get away.
Where will I go? How will I live?
He must leave before the men got there. Time was short.
He gathered everything he could think of that he might need.
He grabbed a large sack and threw in some food. A knife. A small
blanket. A cup. A skin of water. He made his way around the room,
deciding what he needed to carry with him. He came upon the shelf
containing all the Scripture scrolls his father had collected for their
studies. He paused and caressed the length of one of the scrolls,
remembering the many hours his father had spent with him in the
lamplight. His eyes welled up again, and he sank against the wall,
staring at the scrolls.
He had to get out. The men would be here soon.
His eyes darted back around the room again, double-checking
for anything that would be useful. At the moment, nothing seems useful.

INTO THE WILDERNESS

451

Nothing seems necessary. He eyed the scrolls again. In one continuous
motion, he scooped up every one of the scrolls under one arm,
grabbed the sack with the other, and flung open the door. Men in
the distance were heading his way. He took one last moment, looked
back at his parents, clenched his teeth, and ran toward the hills.

Lacidar knelt next to John as the darkness settled in over John’s
first night in the wilderness. John lay flat on his back, and Lacidar
rested his hand on John’s chest. Jaeden and Ry stood near John’s feet.
The makeshift camp under a tree glowed a warm orange from the
waning campfire, but the darkness outside the ring of light grew
deeper now that the sun had gone down. Every unknown sound from
the vast dark wilderness made John twitch and turn. He pulled the
blanket up tight around his neck.
“How am I going to survive?” John muttered toward the
emerging stars. “I have no trade skills. I don’t know how to hunt or
fish. I have no money.”
He smacked his forehead.
“Why didn’t I grab the small stash of money Father had at the
house?”
He flopped his arm over his eyes.
“I have enough food to last for a week, maybe. Enough water for
a couple of days. The first thing I need to do is find a steady source
of water. I can’t very well take water from other people’s wells, and I
don’t know of any springs or streams in the nearby hills.”

Lacidar straightened his back and said, “Go to the Jordan. The
Lord will provide for you there.”
Lacidar’s words spread out like a warm sheet and sank into John’s
chest.
Something in the darkness snapped a twig. John jumped and
turned his head in that direction. After watching for a minute, he
pulled the blanket up around his neck again.
“Maybe I should just go to the Jordan,” John said. “At least
there’s plenty of water there.”
He fidgeted from his side to his back and back to his side again.
Another sound startled him. He rolled on to his back again.
“Of course, I have no idea what I’ll do when I get there,” John
muttered.
“He is never going to be able to sleep tonight,” Jaeden said.
“Yes, he will,” Lacidar said. “He needs the rest. The journey
ahead is hard.”
Lacidar placed both hands over John’s eyes, and spoke, “Peace.
Rest. Sleep.”
His words rolled down to his fingers where they floated like soft
blue clouds and sank through his hands into John’s spirit.
“Peace,” Lacidar repeated.
After several seconds, John became still. A minute later, he fell
asleep.
Lacidar stood up. “He will sleep now. That was a hard day.”
“Even harder than I expected,” Ry said.
“It is a heavy load for a boy not yet sixteen,” Lacidar said.
Jaeden pointed toward the pile of scrolls under the tree. “We did
get him to bring his Scriptures with him.”

“Yes,” said Lacidar. “That was good work. He was such a mess I
wasn’t sure he would be able to hear you. He doesn’t know it now, but
those scrolls are his life.”
Lacidar peered out into the darkness. “BaeLee, Stephanus, and
Kelsof will continue to keep watch at our outer perimeter. I am going
on to the cave we have prepared for John in the wilderness by the
Jordan. I will scout the route and clear out any of the enemy. Then I
will stand guard at the cave and make sure everything is ready there.
Your task is to get John there—John and the scrolls. He will be weak
and disoriented, so you will probably have to prop him up the whole
way. Continue speaking peace and strength into him. He has a long,
hard road ahead.”
“In His service.”
“I will see you in two days.”
***
Two days later, John crested a rocky butte and caught his first
glimpse of the Jordan river. Its calm blue–green waters stretched out
left to right before him.
I can’t believe it. I was beginning to think I was going in the wrong
direction.
He sat on a large rock and reached for his water skin. He lifted
it high over his parched open mouth and squeezed out the last two
drops.
It feels like I’ve been walking for weeks. Another day without water
and I’d have been dead.
He closed his eyes and sighed.

454

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Maybe that would have been better,” he said out loud. “I’m
probably just going to die out here, anyway.”
Something within him stirred. The river is right there. Go get
water. Tomorrow is another day.
“I don’t think I can make it,” he mumbled.
He breathed in a long stream of air. His chest filled with a tiny
spark of hope. You can make it.
He opened his eyes and sighed again. He looked down at the
river.
I can make it.
He stood. He forced his weak legs to take a step. Strength seeped
into his legs from an unknown reservoir. I can make it. He took
another step. More energy strengthened his depleted legs. One step at
a time. Just keep going. With each step, he found just enough power
to take another.
Finally, he reached the bank of the river near a sandy stretch of
beach. He dropped everything, fell to his knees, and collapsed face
first into the water. The refreshing, cleansing water enveloped him.
He came up out of the water for air, and it felt like an entire desert
full of dust and grime had been washed away. For a long time, he lay
in the water letting the current carry away the dirt. He drank it in.
He let the waters flow through his matted hair. He felt almost human
for the first time in days.
I need to find a place to camp for the night. He filled his water skin
and looked up and down the banks of the river. No good campsites
at the riverside. I don’t know why, but I feel like I should try to find a
secluded spot back in the desert a little way. He walked along the bank.
That’s interesting over there—a rocky ravine leading up into some hills.

INTO THE WILDERNESS

455

He turned into the ravine. A mile up the canyon he stopped and sat
on a large rock. He took a drink of water. I don’t even know what I’m
looking for. What am I doing out here? There’s nothing out here but . . .
what’s that? There, on the opposite side, was a good–sized cave twenty
feet above the canyon floor. It looked like it would be inaccessible to
any wild animals from below or above. And it looked high enough
to avoid floodwaters. I think I can get up there. He scrambled up the
rocky cliff side and made his way to the cave entrance.
The low entrance forced him to stoop down to get through, but
once inside, the smooth rock ceiling opened high enough that he
could stand upright. This space is too small. It would not be easy to
spread out a bed in this space. A small passageway jutted off hard to
the right. I wonder where this goes. He ventured around the corner
and pressed his way back into what appeared to be another cavern.
His eyes adjusted to the shadows, and he found himself inside an
enormous room—much bigger than any room in any house he had
ever seen. The ceiling reached at least the height of four men put
together, and the walls felt solid and dry to the touch. The level floor
had patches of soft sand. Although stale and musty, the air felt cool;
and although dim and indirect, the light from the entry provided
sufficient illumination to see around the entire room. The elbow
hallway from the entrance gave protection from the wind and rain.
“This is perfect,” he muttered. “Finally, some good luck.”
He dropped his carrying bag, stood all his scrolls up against a
wall, and examined the room in more detail. He found a nice soft bed
of sand where he could sleep.
“This is good. I’ll camp here until I can find a permanent place
to live.”

he next morning, John woke to gentle light seeping into the cave.
Now what? I have nowhere to go. Nothing to do. Nobody to look for.
Nobody looking for me. Nobody . . . nobody.

Still exhausted from the trip, he went back to sleep. He slept all

day.
The next morning, he got up, drank most of the water in the skin,
and ate. He stood at the entrance of the cave and peered out across
the rocky wilderness. Everywhere he looked, he saw only loneliness,
hopelessness, and lack of purpose. He turned back into the cave and
went back to sleep.

On the third morning, he tipped the water skin up and took the
last swallow of water. He replaced the cap, slapped the skin against his
leg, and sighed. Taking a forced breath, he stood up and hiked back
down to the Jordan. He refilled the water skin and trudged back to
the cave to hide. He didn’t have a conscious thought the whole trip.
Thinking required too much effort. He had too much pain to care.
He went back to sleep.
On the fifth day, he ate the last three dates and the last piece of
stale bread. I don’t know what’s around here. I have no idea where I’m
going to find food. It doesn’t matter. If I starve to death, the pain will be
gone.
On the seventh day, the hunger pains spoke louder than the
mental pain. I have to find something to eat. I’ll look around while I
refill my water. He sat by the bank and stared at the water passing by.
There are probably fish in there, but I have no way to get them.
The final words of his father echoed in the back of his brain,
“John, you are the prophet.”
John laughed out loud. “Some prophet. Here I am in the
wilderness with nowhere to go and no food. Where is God when I
truly need Him?”
A large locust hopped from the riverbank up onto his leg.
John laughed again. “Thanks, God. Maybe I’ll just eat this bug.”
He snatched it up by its tail and hind legs and looked at it with
a crooked smile.
Maybe it won’t be so bad.
He laughed again. “That’s right,” he said to the locust, “maybe
I’ll just eat you.”
Go ahead. Just do it.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

458

He watched the locust a while longer. Its little antennae jerked
this way and that. It tried to kick with its imprisoned legs. John’s
stomach growled.
Eat it already.
“All right!” he shouted.
He closed his eyes and took a chomp. The creature crunched
between his teeth and filled his mouth with locust guts. The thought
of it, the sound of it, the taste of it, was too much. He spat it out and
retched. Even with nothing in his stomach to come up, he retched all
the way from his toes.
He rinsed his mouth, staggered back to the cave, and went to
sleep.
***
Up the ravine, not far from John’s cave, a hive of honeybees
wedged between a crook in the branches of a tree. Lacidar translated
the edge of his sword into the Physical Realm and cut off a small
layer of the hive. A section of honeycomb brimming with fresh honey
chunked to the ground. The bees swarmed around the broken piece
of honeycomb, but then abandoned it and returned to the main hive.
***
The next morning, John’s hunger commanded even more
attention than the day before.
I have to find something to eat. Maybe I’ll head up the canyon
instead of down. Maybe I’ll find some kind of fruit tree, or figs, or dates,
or something.

ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS

459

A little way up the canyon, not far from his cave, John came
across a tree with a beehive in it. A nice piece of honeycomb lay on
the ground below.
His heart leapt, and he let out a little laugh.
I wonder if I could be so lucky.
He retrieved the honeycomb without disturbing the bees—
honeycomb filled with wild honey.
“Yes! Yes!”
With his treasure in hand, he rushed back to his cave.
Inside the cave, he extracted some of the honey into his cup
and devoured the sticky golden nectar with his fingers. The sweetness
filled his starving frame with a warm, intoxicating glow. But, after
downing a whole cup full, he realized he couldn’t get full on honey.
I need something with more substance. Something I can chew.
Hmm. I have an idea.
Back by the river again, this time with a cup full of honey, John
looked for another locust. There were plenty of them around, and
within a minute he caught one by its hind legs.
“Let’s try this again,” he said, dipping the wiggling bug into the
honey.
He swirled it around in the cup for a long time, just to make sure
he had it well-coated. He pulled it out and watched the honey drip
off it. He dunked it back into the cup and swirled some more.
Now you’re stalling.
He held it up to mouth level with the honey dripping off of it,
closed his eyes, and did it. He winced at the crunch, but the wonderful
sweetness of the honey masked the rest of it. Don’t think about it. Don’t
think about it. Just get it down. He swallowed. He waited a minute to

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

460

make sure it would stay down. It seems to be okay. He tried another.
And then another. Soon, he had eaten ten.
It’s nothing like real food, but at least it’s something. Maybe I won’t
starve to death. Still, I don’t know how this might settle. I think that’s
enough for today.
The next day he filled up, and the day after that.
And the day after that.
***
After a month of living in the cave, John set out one cool morning
for his usual walk. He picked a handful of figs in the canyon he had
named “Lonely Canyon,” and, turning his back to the rising sun,
walked up a new ravine he had yet to explore. A short distance up
the ravine, he came across a wild olive tree. He inspected the fruit—
too early to pick. He fingered the olives and tried to remember the
times he picked this fruit with his mother. Even now, a month after
his parents’ deaths, all his memories remained shrouded in a cloud
of pain. He stared at the olives with a blank expression. He couldn’t
picture his mother. His mind saw nothing.
He blinked hard, but the numbness wouldn’t lift. He looked up
and down the ravine.
I’ll name this Abandoned Olive Gulch. I need to remember how to
get back to this olive tree. He stared down the ravine, forming a mental
picture. He turned and continued up to the top where the gulch
began. Standing on the high ground, he surveyed the wilderness in all
directions. A gust of wind blustered across the rocks and flapped his
tunic. He pulled it tight around his body and shivered.

ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS

461

Another month or two, and I’m going to freeze to death.
Off to his left stretched the Jordan river. Behind him, nothing
but wilderness. To his right . . .
What’s that?
John hiked toward something on the ground that looked out of
place. The air became foul. He covered his nose with his hand and
grimaced. Right there, in the middle of his wilderness, a dead camel
lay rotting on the ground. Flies filled the air with the incessant drone
of their buzzing. The putrid odor made John’s eyes water. Scavenger
birds had turned the mound of flesh into a gruesome sight. But in
the midst of this macabre scene, John saw one thing—the warmth of
an animal pelt.
He sat down and stared.
It would be easy to skin the beast and get a covering for winter. I do
have a knife. But there’s that rule in the Nazirite vow about touching a
carcass.
He put his hands under his armpits.
But what does that vow mean now that I’m out here in the wilderness?
Still, the vow was an important commitment to Father. But none of it
means anything if I die this winter from exposure.
For the first time since he left home, John spoke a prayer. “God,
I need your help. I need this animal skin for a coat and a blanket. But
You know the vow I have taken. Show me how to do this without
breaking my vow.”
He sat for a minute looking at the camel. Nothing happened.
Only the sound of buzzing flies. He shook his head and laughed at
himself.

462

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

What was I expecting? It’s not like God is going to speak and give
me instructions. Maybe He will write a note and have a bird bring it.
Maybe the camel itself will start speaking and tell me what to do. It was
a silly prayer.
He sat there, listening to the flies buzz. After a long time, John
got up, circled around the camel several times, and turned to leave.
Maybe I’ll come back tomorrow. Maybe by then I’ll know what to
do.
He took a step toward his cave, but his eye caught some motion
off to the left. He turned his head, and there, just beyond the next
ridge, the top of a man’s head bobbed up and down below the ridge
line. John ducked. His heart raced. That’s the first person I’ve seen out
here! Who could it be?
He forced himself to breathe slower.
Maybe he could help me. I have to take the chance.
He jumped up and ran toward the man. “Excuse me, sir,” John
called out. “Sir, can you hear me?”
John crested the ridge. There are two men, not one. The men
talked with each other on their casual hike through the canyon.
“Excuse me, sirs,” John called out again.
The men stopped and turned toward John.
“Well, hello, young man,” one of the men called back.
The other man put his hand over his eyebrows and looked
toward John, “We are trying to find our way to the Jordan. Do you
know the way?”
“Yes, I can show you the way. It’s not far from here.”
The men sauntered up toward John. They appeared older,
although John couldn’t precisely judge their age. They had swarthy

ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS

463

tan skin, dark hair, and piercing eyes. They seem to be safe enough, but
why would a couple of travelers have no traveling packs?
The first man said, “What a surprise to find another living soul
out in the middle of this wasteland. What in the world are you doing
way out here, son?”
“Well . . . I . . . live out here,” John said.
“No, that is awful. Why?”
“I am . . . I don’t know. Don’t worry about me. I’m doing fine.
But I have a problem I wonder if you could help me with.”
John explained his predicament with the camel and asked if the
men would be willing to skin the animal and clean the hide for him.
“We would be happy to help. My name is Ry, and this is my
good friend Jaeden,” the first man said. “What is your name?”
“My name is John. The camel is over here.”
Hiking back toward the camel carcass, John said, “Those are
interesting names.”
“We’re not from around here,” Jaeden said with a smile.
After several hours of work, the two men had the skin prepared.
They washed it in the Jordan and stretched it out on some rocks near
John’s cave.
“Now, you need to let this set for several weeks,” Ry said. “We
left the hair-side down so the skin side can tan.”
He pulled a large skin flask full of some kind of oil out from
under his tunic. John remained too intent on their instructions to
wonder what this man would be doing with a large container of oil.
“You need to rub this into the skin so it will not get dry and
hard. After a few weeks of doing this, you will be able to cut the hide
into a blanket, an overcoat, or whatever you need.”

“Any questions?”
“No, sir. Thank you both very much for your help. I can’t tell
you how much I appreciate everything you have done.”
“You seem like a very strong young man. I think you are going
to be just fine. May the Lord bless you.”
“And you.” John bowed, and the men walked off.

he black of midnight filled John’s cave, and the snoring of
the young prophet, who nestled under a camel–skin blanket,
provided the only sound in the Physical Realm. Jaeden and Ry

stood guard just inside the cave entrance. Elric and Lacidar stood near
John.

“Thank you for the update,” Elric said to Lacidar. “I will be back
next week.”
Elric turned to leave but stopped when a bright light descended
through the high stone ceiling of the cave. Elric peered into the light,
his hand on the hilt of his sword.

Commander Kai appeared. His huge frame dwarfed the room,
and the glow he carried lit the spiritual air like the afternoon sun.
Elric snapped to attention. “Good evening, commander.”
“Elric. Lacidar. It is good to see you, my friends. Please be at
ease.”
Standing next to Kai, Elric felt small. Power and authority
radiated from the great commander, and Elric could muster only so
much “at ease” in his presence.
“I bring news,” Kai said. “The widow Hannah has passed.”
“Bless the Lord,” Elric said. “She was a valiant warrior for the
Kingdom. Finally, she can rest in the joy of the King. I am very pleased
for her. I am curious though, was it a hard transition? Was she sick?”
“No, she was healthy and full of life. She went to sleep last night,
and the King called her home.”
“Excellent.” Elric beamed with genuine gladness. Lacidar smiled
and nodded his head.
“It has left us with a small situation, though,” Kai said. “And
actually, that is why I am here.”
“Yes, commander. What is it?”
“With her gone from the battlefield, we need to move our
situation room to another location. The umbrella of grace that
covered that place is now removed. I would like to make this cave our
new center of operations for this region.”
“You know, of course, sir, that John is nowhere near the level
Hannah was.”
“Not yet. But he will be. And much more. Over the coming years,
he is going to become the front line of our operations. Strategically,
placing the war room here is the right move.”

NEW OPPORTUNITIES

Lacidar grinned and bounced on his heels. Elric remained stoic
but nodded his head, “By your word.”
Kai smiled and pulled out his giant broadsword. He held it
out horizontally and spoke a word. The sword began a low hum. It
started to glow—red, orange, yellow, a brilliant blue. The frequency
and volume of the humming increased with the changing colors until
they all reached a fierce and breathtaking climax. The commander
lowered the tip of his blade. It touched the ground, and an explosion
of light and intense blue fire erupted. Every surface of the cave—
the walls, the ceiling, the floor—caught fire and burned with searing
blue flames. After several minutes, the flames subsided, and the walls
remained a translucent glowing white, so pure they had sparkles that
twinkled like starlight. In the center of the room, a blue cloud rose
from the floor. It swirled and pulsed and organized into a transparent
form. After another minute of humming and sizzling, the war map
appeared.
Kai slid his sword back into place and smiled. “I will notify the
regional captains. Operations will begin here tomorrow.” He waved
his hand over the map, and it disappeared.
“It is a good work that you do,” Kai said. “The King is pleased.”
He unfurled his giant wings, and with a single flap he disappeared.
Elric glanced over at John. He lay, unmoved, under his camel–
skin blanket. Again, his snoring made the only sound.
***
The next day regional captains filled John’s cave. As each entered,
his giant frame shrank to a size small enough for the room. Elric and

468

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Lacidar stood against a cave wall and watched the ten warriors with
two golden braids on their sleeves gather around the war map. The
captains went straight to work, not paying any notice to their new
surroundings. They pointed at spots on the map and made animated
gestures as they planned timelines and strategies. They discussed
how Rome had just replaced Coponius with Marcus Ambivulus as
procurator of Judea. But most of their discussion centered on the
new appointment of Annas as the High Priest and how the Roman
procurator now controlled the activities of that office.
The lieutenants filed in and gave their reports. The provincial
power struggles between Molech, Asherah, and Yarikh continued
to smolder. They continued to have outbursts and flare-ups, but no
shifts in the seats of power appeared likely. Rebellions and discontent
festered throughout the entire region. The tentacles of darkness
stretched out from the highest seats of power down into every person’s
house. The darkness grew, and pressure built throughout the region.
The logirhim arrived with words from the Throne. The
messengers came and went. Lieutenants shot in and out. Captains
directed operations on a hundred fronts.
Elric leaned in toward Lacidar and whispered, “It has been a
while since I’ve seen the larger picture. Our mission is so focused, it’s
easy to forget all the parts that have to come together.”
“Do you miss the regional work?” Lacidar asked. “The complexity,
the pace?”
Elric’s eyes sparkled, and a slight grin curled his lips. “No. What
I miss is from long ago—perfection, peace, holiness . . . music.”
They watched the controlled mayhem in the middle of the room
for another minute.

Elric crossed his arms and said, “Every day we get closer. Even as
we wait, I feel like time is speeding up. The revelation of the King is
so close—it feels like a mere breath away.”
***
Tumur spied the new developments around the cave where his
young charge, John the prophet, had settled.
What is all this? I drive John into the wilderness where I can keep
him bound up in loneliness and despair, and now this? Months of nothing,
and now John’s cave becomes a headquarters for the enemy?
He watched ten more logirhim arrive and a dozen elzur
lieutenants depart.
How can I reach the prophet now?
He snorted a puff of yellow smoke from his nostrils and sank
back into his hiding spot.
Wait, this could be the break I’ve been waiting for. If John is at the
heart of the King’s plan, surely one or more of these angels might have a
direct connection to the Son of Man. Maybe one of them could lead me to
the prize I truly seek. All I have to do is follow each of these unsuspecting
lieutenants to their assignments and, eventually, one of them will lead me
to Him. Finally, after all the years of waiting, maybe now my persistence
will pay off.

small, gaunt frame tucked easily into the cleft of a rock with only
his bulging round eyes peering from within the shadows. Across

the valley, a steady stream of elzur lieutenants filed out of John’s cave
with their assignments.

One emerged and flew south. No. Another came out and flew
west. No. Already followed him. Six months of this, and I’ve found
nothing. Nothing! Another emerged, looked left and right, and
flew north. Well, here’s one I haven’t followed yet. Let’s see where he

Tumur took off, flying low and ducking in and out of
concealments along the way. He tailed the lieutenant all the way to
the region of Galilee.
A fast one, this. Almost as though he doesn’t want to be followed.
Looks like he is headed to Nazareth. Good. I haven’t searched there yet.
Tumur stopped on a hill just outside of town and tracked the
angelic lieutenant with his eyes to one of the houses in town.
Let’s see who lives here.
He flew into town just above the rooftops and alighted on one
several blocks away from the house. The moment his feet touched
down, a warrior in white appeared from out of nowhere with his
sword drawn. He carried a round shield with a lion embossing.
“You are out of your domain,” the angel said. “Be gone.”
Tumur reached toward his sword, but the angel raised his blade
and stepped forward. Tumur turned and flittered off without a word.
He flew far around the outskirts of town. He snorted a puff of
yellow smoke and looked back. Let’s try this again. He approached
from the opposite direction at rooftop level and landed on a nearby
house.
A warrior in white met him with a drawn sword.
Tumur retreated to a hill outside of town. He spotted a pair
of Roman soldiers on the road leading to town. He flew down and
alighted behind them. Scanning left and right, he started walking
with them. They passed through the city gates and down a main street.
They turned left down a smaller street. As soon as they made the
turn, a huge elzur lieutenant with two swords and no shield stepped
out from behind a building. He took a stance in the middle of the
street, blocking their path. Tumur stopped. The two Roman soldiers

continued walking and passed through the angel. Tumur hesitated,
then took one step forward. The angelic lieutenant reached for his
swords. Tumur stopped. He turned and flew back to the hill outside
of town.
This is very interesting, indeed. This is the most promising prospect
I’ve found yet. I need a way to learn more.
He sat on the hill and looked down over the town. He picked at
his stray fang with a filthy fingernail.
Hmm. Passover is approaching. Perhaps the pilgrimage to Jerusalem
will provide an opportunity to get a closer look.
He found a place to hide and waited.
Two weeks later, the caravan bound for the Passover festival in
Jerusalem formed just outside the city gates. Let’s see if the mysterious
family takes the trip. From the house of interest emerged a large
family—a man, his wife, five boys, and two girls. With a donkey cart
full of provisions, the family merged into the caravan.
Excellent.
He spotted the warriors in white. An elzur captain walked with
the family.
I’ve seen this captain before. I think he might be the one I used to see
come to Zacharias and Elizabeth’s house.
A burly lieutenant with two swords followed behind.
Hello.
Five more warriors formed a perimeter around the family. Flashes
of light in the distance along the horizon caught his eye.
Interesting. There are even more enemy forces out there that I don’t see.
The caravan rumbled southward, and Tumur followed at a
safe distance. Night fell, the troop made camp, and the captain and

FOUND

473

lieutenant stood watch over the one family. The other warriors kept
an outer perimeter.
There is definitely something special about this family.
Four days later, the caravan plodded into Jerusalem and made
camp. Tumur waited under the cloud of settling dust for the next day
when the suspicious family would visit the temple. The next morning,
without a word, every one of the elzurim around the camp made
toward town at different times along different routes and melted into
the bustle. Then, the captain led the way for the family. The youngest
in the family, a girl, looked no more than two and rode straddled on
the mother’s hip. The oldest, a boy, appeared to be about sixteen.
Exactly the age for the Son of Man. The mother seems vaguely
familiar, as though I’ve spied her before. Could she be the one that Luchek
followed all those years ago? With the covering on her head, I can’t be sure.
He slinked in to get a closer look at the boy.
There is nothing about Him that looks extraordinary. I need to get
closer.
An elzur warrior appeared from out of nowhere and diverted
him away. He didn’t resist. That’s fine. I know their destination. He
took to the air and headed straight for the temple. He alighted on top
of the broad outer wall and perched like a sinister invisible gargoyle
and waited.
The family arrived and weaved their way through the outer
court. This is a perfect spot to watch from. I don’t know what to look
for, but I’m sure I’ll see something if I stay persistent. The father and
the boy left the rest of the family and headed toward the Court of
the Israelites. That’s strange . . . it’s subtle . . . but I definitely think I
see . . .

Everywhere the boy moved, a region devoid of beaelzur presence
seemed to develop around Him. It looked like an invisible bubble
that insulated Him from the forces of darkness. With all the motion
and jostling and mixing, it would be impossible to notice it from
ground level. But with his perspective and attentive eye . . . I need to
test it—to see just how close I can get.
With a few erratic flaps of his leathery wings, he landed just
outside the no–enter radius. Without a break in his motion, he
proceeded inward toward the boy. In an instant, an elzur warrior,
much bigger than he, appeared from the right and pressed his
formidable forearm into Tumur’s chest.
“Take it somewhere else,” the angel commanded, low and firm.
“I was just going over—”
“Somewhere . . . else,” the angel said.
“You have no right to restrict me from—”
The angel reached for his sword.
“Fine, fine,” Tumur grunted. He smiled, flapped his wings, and
took off.
Back on the top of the wall, he resumed his gargoyle stance
and watched for more signs. A moment later, without warning, a
broadsword almost as wide as his whole body appeared in front of
him in a huge sweeping arc. The sword flat-bladed him across the
chest and launched him with more force than he’d ever known. A
maniacal laugh squeaked out. Senturim! He tumbled through the sky
at least a mile before he could regain control of his flailing body. This
provided the final confirmation. I have seen enough. There is no need
to continue the search.

Tumur perched on the brow of the cliff at Nazareth and
gazed down at the distant road leading to Jerusalem. With the sun
disappearing behind the horizon on his right, his foot tapped an
anxious cadence. Another week and a half before the festival is over and
the Son of Man is back at home.
A thin trail of yellow smoke seeped out his nostrils.
Then what? I should report this to Marr—or Molech, Yarikh, or
Asherah.
He sneered and grunted.
Glory–hungry power mongers. I hate them all. Every one would
steal my prize. I owe no allegiance to them.
He brooded as the silent nightfall crept across the landscape.
But if the dark lord finds out I withheld information about the
King . . .
He stretched his neck, stroked it with his hand, and swallowed
hard.
But if I destroy the flesh of the Son of Man myself . . .
His bulging eyes widened, and he cackled.
Power, glory, my rightful place on the mountain of the King.
He cackled again.
Yes—I will claim the prize for myself. But how? How can I reach
Him? This captain and his team have the King hemmed in. I’ll never get
close enough.

His eyes wandered across the panorama below. His mind
wandered through strategic options. Several minutes passed.
Something on the distant trail caught his eye—a troop of eight
Roman soldiers on a brisk march. Their long spears rested against
their shoulders, and the iron tips bobbed up and down with each
deliberate step. Tumur smiled.
That’s it.

From his perch on the cliff at the edge of Nazareth, Tumur’s
gargoyle frame cast no shadow in the early–morning sunlight. He
sulked with his chin in his hands and waited. Hours passed, and he
sat still as a stone statue. He spotted something on the trail below. He
squinted and waited another minute to be sure. Two Roman soldiers
trudged up the trail toward Nazareth.
“Yes!” he shouted.
He jumped to his feet and wrung his hands.
For this I have waited weeks. The Boy and His father are working
outside by their house, and I finally have vessels to work with. This is it!
My time has finally come.
He stepped off the edge of the cliff and plummeted downward.
He opened his wings and swooped down toward the sloping plain.
He alighted just behind the marching soldiers. He tucked his wings
away and joined the march. With one hand on each of the Roman
soldiers’ shoulders, he walked between them and spoke into their

Quiet. None of Timrok’s team were visible. He glanced back at Joseph

Jesus grabbed one from a freshly cut pile and passed it up to

Elric’s attention returned to the surroundings. Our world here in
Nazareth is so small. No one has any idea that the King is here. They all
go on about their lives—never knowing that, day by day, we draw closer
to the moment when He is revealed. The time is so close. The day we have
longed for since—
A flash of light from the right. A signal from Timrok. Elric’s jaw
tightened, and he focused down the street. Timrok appeared from
around the corner, on the street walking fast. He motioned with his
hands. Elric unsheathed his sword.
Two Roman soldiers turned the corner and marched up the dirt
road that passed by Joseph and Mary’s house. They carried traveling
packs on their backs and conspicuous broadswords at their sides.
One soldier—probably the ranking one—had a smaller pack, but
the other had an enormous one. They kept a brisk pace, but they
looked weary from a long trek. Elric studied them for any signs of
enemy spirits. They appeared to be alone. Timrok drew up beside
them and spoke to them as they walked, but his words bounced off
their darkened spiritual shells like water. The soldiers would pass by
Joseph and Jesus on the road within seconds, despite Timrok’s best
efforts. Elric positioned himself between Jesus and the incoming
soldiers. The soldiers approached, and one motioned to the other and
pointed toward Joseph and Jesus. The other soldier nodded. They
came to a stop on the trail just in front of the house. Elric held his
stance between them and Jesus. Timrok stood behind and searched
the area for enemy forces.
“Boy,” the first soldier called out.
Jesus stopped with a plank of wood in His hand, straightened up
and turned around. From the back of the wagon Joseph looked up.

The soldier pulled a large water skin he had slung around his shoulder
by a leather strap and tossed it toward Jesus. It flew through Elric and
landed in the dirt with a flap of dust.
“Fetch us some fresh water,” the soldier said.
The second soldier flung his water skin, which also passed
through Elric and landed next to the other. Jesus looked back to
Joseph, who answered with a terse nod and concerned eyes. Jesus laid
the wood down and gathered the two skins. Joseph jumped down off
the wagon. Jesus made His way to the street, being careful to keep
a safe distance from the soldiers, and the soldiers helped each other
lower their packs from their backs. The packs landed in the dust with
a thud.
Jesus ran down the path toward the village well. Elric nodded to
Timrok, who followed close to Jesus.
Joseph stood with his hammer hanging limp in his hand and
stared at the soldiers. His meager peasant clothes looked insignificant
next to the brass and leather and iron of the soldiers. The soldiers
looked away, eying the people on the streets and the pockets of
gathering neighbors. The villagers spoke to each other in whispers
and shielded their mouths with their hands. Joseph straightened the
pile of wood planks, never taking his eyes off the soldiers.
Joseph cleared his throat and said, “Staying long in Nazareth?”
The ranking soldier grunted.
“Our goal is Sepphoris by nightfall,” the second soldier said.
“We require only a fresh supply of water.”
The ranking soldier elbowed the other. “These people do not
need to know our plans.” He turned to Joseph. “Where is your boy?
How long does it take to draw water?”

“Not long. I’m sure He’ll be back shortly.”
Elric, still positioned between Joseph and the soldiers, watched
down the street for another minute. Finally, Jesus and Timrok
reappeared. Jesus ran with hurried steps, but Timrok’s long gait
looked smooth and effortless.
“Finally,” the senior soldier said.
Seconds later, Jesus handed the bulging water skins to the soldiers
and stepped back by Joseph. The soldiers slung the skin straps around
their shoulders and moved toward their packs.
Zzzzztt! A sizzling whistle zipped past Elric. He glanced at Jesus
and Joseph. Nothing unusual. He turned to the soldiers. The words
“take him” glowed on the black spiritual armor of the ranking soldier
and sank into his spirit.
“We’re under attack!” Elric shouted.
“Where?” Timrok said, pivoting all the way around. “I don’t see
them.”
The soldier stopped reaching for his pack and stood upright. He
cocked his head to the side. “Boy!” the soldier said with a commanding
voice. “Come here.”
Jesus took two steps forward.
Elric widened his stance.
“You will carry this pack,” the soldier said.
“No,” shouted Joseph. “You can’t force Him to do that.”
“I can,” the soldier said. “By Roman law I can conscript for a
mile.”
“But He’s just a boy. I will carry it.”
The soldier paused a moment.

482

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Leave the Boy alone,” Elric spoke. His words rolled up and
bounced off the soldier’s dark shell.
Two small fireballs sizzled past Elric and collided into the soldier.
The words “take the boy” and “do it now” absorbed into his spirit.
Elric turned toward the origin of the fireballs and pointed.
“There!” he shouted to Timrok. “Rooftop!”
“I see him!” With a powerful stroke of his wings, Timrok shot
toward the attacker.
A stream of fireballs sizzled inward toward the soldiers. Timrok
barreled directly through the barrage, slashing some with his swords.
Dozens made it through. “Take the boy!” “Take him now!” “Use
force!” “Kill him!” “Take him!” Elric blocked most with his shield,
the energy ricocheting off into shattered bits of plasma. Still, both the
soldiers received multiple hits, which sank into their spirits.
The soldiers both appeared agitated at Joseph and advanced. The
second soldier reached for his sword. The first reached toward Jesus.
“Enough of this insolence!” the ranking soldier said. “I said the
boy will carry this pack, and if I have to strap it to his back myself, he
is going to carry it.”
“No!” Joseph shouted, moving to block the soldier’s way to Jesus.
His left arm extended toward the soldier. His right hand still held his
working hammer.
Just before Joseph’s left hand touched the soldier, Elric’s forearm
caught the soldier across the middle of his chest and knocked him flat
on his back.
Kylek appeared and positioned his foot on the downed soldier’s
chest.
Jesus rushed toward Joseph, reaching for the back of Joseph’s
shirt.

MAN OF SORROWS

The stream of fireballs from the rooftop stopped.
Joseph stumbled forward, his right hand raising for balance.
The second soldier lunged forward, lifted his sword over his
head, and slashed downward with a dreadful shout.
His blade caught Joseph’s right arm just above the elbow and
sliced clean through the flesh and bone. Joseph’s forearm dropped like
a lifeless piece of meat, and Joseph careened backward. He tripped,
spun, and crashed to the ground hard, his head smashing against a
large stone. He didn’t move. Blood gushed from his severed arm and
gashed head and pooled in the thirsty dirt.
“What have you done?” the ranking soldier shouted. He tried to
stand back up, but with Kylek’s foot on his chest, he couldn’t seem to
get to his feet.
“He was going to attack you with his hammer,” the second
soldier said.
Elric knelt next to Joseph and put his hand on Joseph’s chest,
speaking words of strength. A flash of light from Timrok on the
roof signaled he had the attacker under control. On the street, the
passersby and neighbors bunched into groups and gathered around.
Jesus flopped down and draped His arms over Joseph with His head
on Joseph’s chest.
He wailed between sobs, “No! No! No!”
Elric lifted his hand from Joseph’s chest and placed it just above
Jesus’ back. He paused. Do I touch Him? Do I dare? Do I . . . He
lowered his hand directly upon His back and spoke, “Strength. Peace.
Strength. Strength.”
“Ima!” Jesus screamed. “Ima, come quickly!”
Mary emerged from inside the house with little Rachael and Jude
peeking out from the front door. The gathering crowds pressed in.

484

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Joseph!” Mary squealed. She ran toward the scene. “What
happened? What happened?”
Jesus sat up long enough to point at the soldiers. His hand
dripped with Joseph’s blood.
The ranking soldier called out to the other. “Quickly, get your
pack. We need to get out of here.”
“But he was attacking you,” the second soldier said.
“Look around,” the first soldier said. “We are going to have a
riot here shortly, and we have no reinforcements.” He tried to sit up.
Elric nodded to Kylek, who stepped back. The soldier scrambled
to his feet. The two soldiers hoisted their packs with one arm while
holding their swords out toward the incoming crowds. The soldiers
backed away toward the street and made a hurried retreat. The people
rushed inward toward Joseph. Mary tore a strip of cloth from her
dress and made frantic attempts to stop the bleeding from Joseph’s
arm.
In the midst of all the screaming and mayhem, a shimmering
white angel appeared from above and alighted next to Elric. Elric
stood and gave him a small, sad, smile. He crossed his arms, stepped
back, and waited.
A moment later, Joseph’s spirit stood up. Joseph looked at Elric
and the other angel, then down at his broken shell of a body. A swarm
of people gathered all around, yelling, crying, wailing—and paying
no attention to the three of them standing there. Joseph looked dazed
and confused.
“What happened?” Joseph said. “What’s going on?”
Elric stepped forward and leaned down to put his arm around
Joseph’s shoulder.

“Am I dead?” Joseph asked.
“Joseph, it has been my true honor to have served the King
alongside you. You have been a faithful steward of the gift entrusted
to you. We still have a long way to go, but you have completed your
course. Your work on earth is finished, and now it is time for you to
enter your rest. I want you to go with my friend here.”
“But what about Jesus?”
“He is exactly where He should be. You have provided well for
Jesus as an earthly father. Now He will know the provision of the
heavenly Father. Come, it is time for you to go. There is work here I
must attend to.”
Joseph and his escort left. Elric motioned to Timrok on the
rooftop. A moment later, the stout lieutenant had his prisoner at
ground level in front of Elric. Elric still watched Jesus and Mary, who
now realized Joseph was dead. They wailed uncontrollably.
“Captain,” Timrok said. “I present Tumur.”
Elric turned and faced Tumur with stern eyes and clenched teeth.
Timrok had Tumur pinned with his arms behind his back and his feet
dangling just above the ground. Timrok muscled him forward. Elric
stood with a tight jaw and his sword hanging tip-down.
“What’s the matter, Captain?” Tumur said. “Can’t find the words
for the moment?”
Timrok tightened his hold.
Tumur’s bulging eyes didn’t flinch. “Admit it—I won the battle
here today. I may not have reached the Son of Man this time, but I
did get His father. Ha! You puppets think you are so superior. Admit
it—I bested you all. And what’s more, I know where the Son of Man

is. I will come back with my lord and there is nothing you will be
able to do to stop us.”
Elric’s sword began to glow blue. Elric looked down at it, smiled,
and looked back at Tumur. He lifted the flaming blade high above his
head. He brought it crashing downward.
“Noooo,” squealed Tumur.
Elric’s sword sliced through Tumur from the top of his head all
the way down his torso, rending the spirit in half. By the time Elric
finished his swing, nothing remained of Tumur but a dissipating
yellow vapor. Timrok’s hands held nothing but smoke. He rubbed his
hands together as though wiping away the filth. Elric turned back to
the scene in the Physical Realm.
Jesus and Mary clung to Joseph’s dead body and sobbed. The
men from the village pulled at them from behind, urging them to let
go so they could get in and move the body.
“I’m sorry, Captain,” Timrok said. “He was just outside our
perimeter. But still within range to strike. We will expand our radius
and double our efforts so this can never happen—”
Elric cut him off with a raised hand and a half smile. His left eye
twitched twice, and he hid his twitch from Timrok behind his hand.
He took a deep breath. “Make a full sweep of the area. Make sure
there are no others. Make sure no one else saw this. Then send word
to Zaben, Jenli, and Lacidar—we will meet here tonight. Tell Lacidar
to bring his resonar.”
Timrok flew off, and Elric stepped over to the place where Joseph
had fallen. From the pool of blood, the energy of the innocent life
rose from the earth and formed a large spiritual stone in the Middle
Realm. Elric picked up the stone and placed it next to Joseph and

Mary’s house. He stood with his back to the house and closed his
eyes. One day. One day.
***
Elric and the four lieutenants gathered in the corner of the main
living room of Joseph and Mary’s house. By the dim light of one oil
lamp, Mary and her children wept. The raw shock of the afternoon
had turned into a deep well of pain that fed an unending stream of
tears.
“A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief,” Elric said. “This
was foretold of Him by His prophet Isaiah.”
Jenli looked at Jesus and shook his head. “It is strange to see
the King in such pain. I am used to sensing it from the Throne. But
seeing Him like this is like nothing I could have ever imagined.”
“Yes,” Elric said. “He now has felt the sting of death in a way
none of us can never know.”
“I wonder,” Timrok said. “Will this be enough to cause Him to
launch His campaign?”
Elric shook his head. “I think not. Just the opposite. Jesus is now
the man of the house, and all the weight of providing for the family
will be on His shoulders.”
Zaben nodded. “I believe you are right. There is no way Jesus
will start His campaign until He has fulfilled His responsibilities to
His family. That means He will probably be here until little Rachael
gets married.”
“She’s two and a half now,” Jenli said. “That means we have at
least another thirteen to fourteen years.”

“The time is getting close,” Lacidar said.
“Mmm,” Elric said, rubbing his chin. “Tell me, who was this
Tumur?”
“We know little about him,” Timrok said. “He was not among
any of Molech, Asherah, or Yarikh’s inner circles. Low rank. He
appeared to be acting alone.”
“Tumur . . . Tumur,” Lacidar said. “I may have seen him in Judea,
in Zacharias’s synagogue, stirring up dissension against Zacharias.”
Timrok stroked his beard. “Perhaps he had discovered John and
eventually found his way here.”
“This attack tells us two things,” Zaben said. “First—they are
still seeking Him. It has been so quiet here for so long, I was beginning
to wonder.”
“They are concentrating on Egypt,” Timrok said.
“And Bethlehem,” Jenli said.
“Second,” Zaben said, “the King remains hidden from Marr’s
main forces. If Tumur had not been acting alone, we would have
certainly seen legions.”
Elric crossed his arms and lifted his chin. “This attack tells us
a third thing—we are still very vulnerable. Let us not lose focus.
Compared to the millennia we have waited, the revelation of the
King is close upon us. But we still have much to accomplish. Beyond
our primary goal of keeping the King hidden, we must see to the
prophet John and we must help prepare the King’s twelve generals
for His army.”
Jenli motioned with his hand to the human occupants of the
room. “And now, we must also minister to a hurting family.”

“Yes,” Elric said. “Thank you. Lacidar, this is why I asked you
to bring your resonar. You are the most skilled among us to minister
peace and restoration. I want you to stay here and help Mary and the
children through this difficult time. Timrok and I will continue to
focus on the military details.”
Lacidar’s eyes welled up with tears and an enormous smile
covered his face. “It would bring me no greater joy.”
“It may be a while—six months or more,” Elric said.
“A century to minister to the King is not long enough for me.”
Elric smiled.
Lacidar moved to the corner of the room nearest the family and
strummed his resonar. Waves of peace filled the room and washed
across Mary and the children. Within minutes, the youngest ones
became quiet and fell asleep in the older ones’ arms.

ix months after Joseph’s death, Elric and the lieutenants gathered
in John’s cave over the war map. Zaben drew near the end of
his report. “And the final updates on the inner twelve are about

James and John, sons of Zebedee. My warriors Christov and Carothim
are growing concerned about a situation there. As you know, Zebedee
is a fisherman who works out of Capernaum. Several years ago, a young
man named Daniel hired on, but we know he is possessed by the enemy.
We monitor the enemy’s activity closely, and so far, he has not had any
direct impact on our mission. Daniel is only near Zebedee while they
are on the boats and working. While on the water, the enemy mostly

releases control to Daniel. When he is off duty, the demon becomes
more controlling. To quiet the enemy’s voice, Daniel stays drunk and
sometimes sleeps outside the synagogue at Capernaum. Our concern is
Zebedee has started bringing James and John out on the boats, and they
are having direct contact with Daniel. As Zebedee continues to teach
the boys the fishing trade, contact with Daniel will become frequent and
difficult to control.”

“Do you know the name of the demon?” Elric asked.
“A lieutenant named Vorsogh,” Zaben said.
“Vorsogh?” Lacidar shouted. “Vorsogh is the one who attacked
the prophet John in the temple and shot words of death into Zacharias
and Elizabeth.”
Elric’s eyebrows raised, and he crossed his arms. “Disturbing to
cross paths again with this one. Does he know our mission there with
James and John?”
Zaben shook his head. “I don’t think so. We keep our distance
and leave him alone.”
“It is time to separate Vorsogh from the sons of Zebedee,” Elric
said.
Zaben bit his lip and nodded. “Yes, sir.”
“Lacidar,” Elric said.
Lacidar turned his head. “Captain?”
“Your ministry to Mary’s family has been excellent. Jesus, of
course, receives every word you speak and sing, and He draws great
strength from the Father. I feel, though, that the others still need your
ministry—especially Mary. I would like you to continue your work
with them a while longer.”
Lacidar smiled and bowed his head.

“It will not be much longer, though,” Elric said. “I believe John
is going to need you soon.”
***
From the hidden moonlight shadows across the plaza from the
synagogue at Capernaum, Zaben, Christov, and Carothim watched
Daniel fight the voice of Vorsogh within his mind in order to get
a night’s rest. Daniel finished the last of his wine and passed out,
crumpled against the synagogue’s outer wall. The restlessness of
Vorsogh twitched within Daniel’s limp arms and legs.
“Do you have a plan?” Christov asked with his voice low and
muffled.
Zaben bit his lip and nodded. “Nothing elaborate. We only
need to put distance between Daniel and Zebedee’s family. If Daniel
leaves, Vorsogh leaves. I think we simply need to convince Zebedee
to dismiss Daniel from his business.”
“Some of the other men on the crew have seen Daniel stealing
from Zebedee—fish and money, both,” Carothim said.
“And he often comes to work impaired from wine,” Christov
said.
Zaben nodded. “You two speak to the crew. It’s time they share
their observations with Zebedee. I will speak to Zebedee so that his
eyes will be opened.”
Christov and Carothim answered, “Yes, sir.”
“Do not be seen directly with James and John until Vorsogh is
gone. He mustn’t become suspicious of a larger plan. I will stay with
Zebedee—in the open—to protect him in case Vorsogh becomes

violent. If Zebedee brings the boys out on a fishing trip, I may require
your support, but stay hidden unless needed.”
Two men passed by Daniel on the path. An elzur warrior walked
with them, shimmering and white. As they passed, the angel never
took his gaze off Daniel.
“Look,” Zaben whispered. “Look how quiet and still Vorsogh
became. I can see why Daniel likes to come here.”
“If only we could free Daniel from his bondage at the same time
that we drive Vorsogh away,” Christov said.
“I agree. But we have no authority. This one has given himself
over to the enemy.”
***
Tall, knobby clouds piled up in the south as three fishing boats
left the shores at Capernaum. Squawking birds circled around the
masts, and the water lapped along the graceful wooden hulls. Zebedee
stood at the tiller of one boat. Six crew members of his boat tended
nets and prepared for another night of working the lake. Zebedee
surveyed the other two boats gliding along to his left—with their
crews hard at work, and he raised his bearded chin into the breeze.
His crew tonight included his sons James and John—teenagers, but
carrying their weight. Zebedee smiled.
He eyed one of his other crewmembers, and his smile turned
flat. Levi. Such a strange young man. I don’t know what it is about
him, but he always makes me feel uneasy. Zebedee had been hearing
disturbing reports about Levi from the other crew members over the
last week. I need to watch Levi close this trip.

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

494

Levi worked the nets with the others without much conversation.
He kept glancing up at Zebedee with a strange look in his eyes. The
men finished with the nets, and Levi moved all the way to front of
the bow, the farthest point away from Zebedee. Even from there, he
continued shooting nervous glances back toward the tiller.
The evening brought a gentle breeze, which they bridled and
rode south. They planned to start south and work their way back
north along the eastern side. They had made it almost half the way
down the lake when the breeze gave out and they slid to a stop. The
night felt eerie with no moon, and the glow of lanterns hanging from
each boat mast revealed a lake surface black and glasslike. A handful
of lamps in the windows from the nearby town of Gergesa, just a few
miles inland to the east, reflected off the water and provided the only
other distinguishable reference in the dark.
“Time to go to work, men,” Zebedee announced from the back
of the boat. “Let down the nets.”
Sounds of action cut through the stillness—knocks on the
wooden hull, swooshing of nets, and splashes in the water. The same
sounds from the other two boats echoed across the water. It became
still again, and they waited. The other men talked in the calm.
Levi retreated to the bow alone. After an hour, all the men worked
together and hoisted the nets back in with their catch. They wrestled
the nets into the boat and pulled them back, dumping the fish into
the bottom of the boat. Not a big catch—maybe a few dozen—but
the flopping fish around their feet made it challenging to get the nets
back into the water. With the nets down again, they waited for the
next haul.

OVERBOARD

495

The men talked and laughed amongst themselves, and Zebedee
looked past them at Levi up at the bow. I suppose I should go talk
with him. His stomach balled up in a knot. Lately, the unexplainable
uneasiness he felt around Levi had become even stronger. I need to
confront him about the allegations of theft and drunkenness and decide
what to do about it.
Zebedee tiptoed through the fish and steadied himself with the
mast, and with each step, the dread about the impending conversation
grew stronger. The weather remained calm, but Zebedee had seen the
clouds before the sun went down. He looked upward into the starless
sky. Feels like a storm building. Can’t help but wonder if we’re in the calm
before the storm. He took another step and glanced forward at Levi,
who was hunched over and facing forward as if hiding something.
The calm before the storm . . .
The first breeze of a night storm sent warning ripples across the
waters.
Zebedee reached the front of the boat. “Levi, we need to talk.”
Levi startled to Zebedee’s voice, and he sat upright with a half
turn. He fumbled to stash something beneath his tunic.
“What is that? What do you have?” Zebedee said. He caught
Levi’s arm before he could get his secret concealed.
“A flask? What’s in here?” Zebedee smelled the open top. “This
is wine! You are drinking on the job?”
Levi looked up at Zebedee with vacant, glassy eyes and grunted.
His voice sounded unearthly and sent a sharp chill through Zebedee’s
bones.
“You are drunk! I can’t believe it. I needed to talk with you about
some disturbing things I have been hearing about you. I was hoping

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

496

you could convince me they were all misunderstandings, but now—
now, this is too much. I can’t have somebody on my crew who I can’t
trust, and I certainly can’t have somebody on the crew who is a drunk.
This is your last fishing trip. When we get back into port, you are
going to have to find employment elsewhere.”
Levi’s face contorted like a vicious animal. “You can’t do this to
us.” His voice growled like nothing Zebedee had ever heard. A gust of
wind came up and ruffled the hair on both of their heads.
“What do you mean ‘us’? ” Zebedee said. “I don’t understand
how you could do this to me. I took you in when you had
nothing. No skills. No money. And I trained you up like you were
my own son. I gave you a good job and taught you the tools of the
trade. I knew you were having some problems, but I’ve given you so
many chances. And how do you repay me? You steal from me.
You come to work drunk. You—”
Levi reached into his cloak and pulled out a long knife. The
silver blade flashed in the light of the lantern.
“What’s that?” Zebedee squeaked. “What are you doing?”
“You can’t just disown us,” Levi said, his voice low and guttural.
“This is even worse than what my father did to us. I hate you. I hate
you all. I’m going to kill every one of you and take this boat for
myself. We don’t need you.” He started to stand up with the gleaming
silver of the blade pointed at Zebedee.
The sail gave a loud crack. A huge gust of wind took hold of the
ship. The boom from the sail swung around hard, and the entire boat
listed in a tight turn. Zebedee fell backward. Levi reached for the side
of the boat, and his knife tumbled out of his hand.

497

A flash storm from the south was upon them, and within
moments the boat was engulfed in heavy seas and driving rain.
“Captain!” the men called.
“I know,” Zebedee called back. He clambered to his feet and
rushed toward the tiller. “Quickly—get those nets back in the boat!
You—drop the sail! Move, everybody move!”
The crew scrambled. The boat heaved and rolled, and waves
crashed in over the sides. Zebedee fought the tiller to keep the boat
turned into the wind, and through flashes of lightning he watched
the crew struggle for their lives against the raging elements. James and
John pulled on the nets with all their might. Another crewmember
pulled on mast ropes. Two others bailed water. All battled to stay
upright and not get thrown overboard or be swept away by a crashing
wave. During one lightning flash, Zebedee spotted Levi, still on the
bow of the boat, swinging his arms like a wild man and jumping
around as though fighting someone.
For half an hour the squall tested Zebedee and his crew. With
each flash of lightning, Zebedee witnessed the courage and strength
of his men. If they were to go down tonight, it wouldn’t be for lack
of effort.
As quickly as it hit, the storm subsided. The wind continued
strong enough to create a rough ride over white–capped swells, but
the rain stopped, and the dire danger to the boat receded. Someone
relit the lantern.
The first glow of the lantern flickered across the deck. There sat
James and John, drenched and exhausted atop the fishing nets.
“Did you two bring those nets up by yourselves?” Zebedee called
out.

498

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Yes, sir,” James yelled. John nodded.
“But how? There’s no way you could—”
“Captain,” one of the other crewmembers yelled. “Look!”
The lantern from one of the other boats lit up.
“Good,” Zebedee said. “That’s good.”
A moment later, the lantern from the third boat flickered on.
“Yes,” Zebedee said. “We’re all still afloat. Let’s keep bailing that
water. How is everyone? Is anyone hurt? Is everyone—where’s Levi?”
Everyone looked around the boat.
“The last time I saw him, he was up on the bow,” one of the men
said.
“He must have been swept overboard,” Zebedee yelled. “Signal
the other boats. Hoist the sail. We’re coming around.”
“Captain, with that storm, there’s not much hope we can—”
“All eyes on the sea,” Zebedee shouted. “He’s out there, and we
need to find him.”
A half an hour of desperate searching passed, and they saw no
sign of Levi.
“Captain,” a crewmember said, “with the speed we were being
driven by those winds, even if we had turned around the moment he
fell off, we would have left him far behind.”
“Keep looking,” Zebedee said.
Another half hour passed.
“Captain, by now all hope is lost. We need to concentrate on
getting ourselves home safely.”
The whole crew turned and waited for Zebedee’s response.
Zebedee’s face remained stern and determined. He looked out
over his tired crew. He looked out over the water.

499

“You’re right,” he said with a defeated tone. “Signal the other
boats. Let’s go home.”
The boat came about, and the sails propelled them northward at
a vigorous pace. All the while, Zebedee kept watching behind their
wake—scanning the black waters and seeing nothing. A quiet sadness
settled in over the crew during the journey.
They made it back to port that night—sail tattered, nets torn,
catch swept away, and a man lost.
***
Daniel screamed for help between each crashing wave, but his
voice became lost in the uproar of the wind and the rain and the
waves. The boat sped past him, driven by the strong winds; and even
swimming as hard as he could, he had no hope of catching it. Within
only a few minutes, the bouncing mast lit by the flashes of lightning
disappeared, leaving Daniel alone in the deep.
Alone. Alone in the darkness—bobbing over the wave crests and
tumbling between the swells. Even though he had become a proficient
swimmer since joining Zebedee’s crew, the buried memories of his
childhood encounter with the sea seized his mind. Panic gripped
his whole body. He flailed and fought to stay afloat. He gasped and
sputtered and tried to catch his breath between plunges. He lost all
sense of direction.
At the top of one swell, he caught a glimpse of the lights of
Gergesa. Need to swim toward the lights. He tumbled under another
wave and couldn’t tell which direction was up. He felt dizzy. He flailed
some more, got tumbled again, and then everything went black.

aniel awoke early in the morning on the rocks of an unknown
shore. He lay on his back. He blinked and squinted in the
daylight. A steep cliff rose to meet him from the east. He sat
up and looked west. The lake appeared calm and beautiful. A few clouds
floated above. The entire scene seemed so quiet and picturesque that it
left Daniel confused.
Where am I? What am I doing here? How did I get here?
He tried to remember the previous day, and although it seemed
dreamlike, he could remember that he had been on the fishing boat
at night and there was a terrible storm. He remembered falling in the
water and then . . . then there was nothing.

“Levi?” Daniel whispered. “Levi, are you here?”
“Of course, little brother,” the voice answered in Daniel’s ear. “I
am always here.”
“I was drowning last night. It’s not possible that I could have
gotten ashore by myself. Did you save me?”
“Yes, I did not want to lose you.”
Daniel sat for several minutes and watched the ripples of water
slide into the shore just beyond reach of his feet. He thought about
his life and the hopeless place in which he now found himself—again.
“I wish you would have let me go,” Daniel said. “Besides, you
wouldn’t have lost me. We could have truly been together.”
“You don’t understand, little brother, I need you as much as you
need me.”
“What do you mean?”
“In the spirit world, I would just wander around without a body.
You have given me a new chance at life. With the two of us working
together, I get to see and smell and feel all the tangible reality of the
physical world. We are more together right now than we could ever
be. You wouldn’t want to lose that, would you?”
“No, I suppose not. But what are we going to do now? I’ve lost
my job, and we’re in a strange place.”
“Worry not. There is a town nearby. We shall find another fishing
job, or maybe even become pig ranchers.”
Daniel cringed. “Pigs? Unclean, defiled creatures.”
The voice said, “And delicious. Just think of what Father would
say if he saw you working swine.”
Daniel smirked with a rebellious glint in his eye.

The midmorning sun warmed the stone canyon walls around
John’s wilderness cave. Cheerful songs of the birds floated on the
breeze. Elric and Lacidar stood in the opening of John’s cave looking
out.
“You have been back in the wilderness a year now,” Elric said to
Lacidar. “Are you glad to be back with John?”
Lacidar gave a sly grin. “Come, Captain,” Lacidar said. “You
need to see this.”
Elric and Lacidar leapt down to the ground below John’s cave,
walked up the canyon, and turned hard right into a smaller ravine,
which opened up into a small alcove. It felt to Elric like a small
courtyard in a temple—flat, smooth ground and towering walls of
stone all around. Some of the rock formations looked like pillars in
a palace. Near one side of the alcove, a deposit of large boulders had
sheared from the walls and sat arranged like century–old pieces of
art. The prophet John sat on one boulder and leaned forward on
his elbows over a large, flat, table-like slab of stone. Rays of sunlight
beamed in through the open roof of the courtyard and shined down
on a scroll of parchment stretched out on the stone table.
“What is he doing?” Elric asked.
“Reading. From the book of Psalms this morning, I think.”
Jaeden overlooked the courtyard from a stone perch two-thirds
up the sheer wall. Elric turned and looked up the wall behind him.
Ry stood guard from his own high perch.
Lacidar motioned around the courtyard with his hand. “This has
become his favorite place.”

Elric nodded and smiled.
“As you know,” Lacidar said, “the first year in the wilderness was
the hardest for John. He was broken, filled with pain, and terribly
alone. We spent many hours strengthening him, singing to him,
keeping him going. The Spirit of the King spoke to him constantly,
although I think he heard little of it. He rarely prayed. He didn’t read.
His thoughts were empty.”
“He suffered much trauma. We’ve seen this response thousands
of times,” Elric said.
Lacidar nodded. “When we established our war room in his
cave, it seemed to help. He was still unable to hear in the spirit, but
the continual presence of so many elzurim provided strength when
there was none.”
“And now?”
“Several months ago, he began reading his scrolls—mostly out
of boredom, I think. And now, his ears are beginning to open. The
veil over his eyes is starting to lift.”
“I sense he is still disconnected,” Elric said.
“Yes—disconnected from people, disconnected from everything
in the outside world, disconnected from himself. But I think his
disconnection from the King is starting to close.”
Elric crossed his arms and nodded. “Actually, the disconnection
from the world is probably a good thing right now. He doesn’t need
to know Annius Rufus is the new Roman procurator of Judea or
about the political unrest and uprisings throughout the land. He
doesn’t even need to know the King himself just spent the last two
years working through personal tragedy of His own.”

“This is a good start for the prophet,” Lacidar said.
“Yes, it is. And it means our time draws closer every day.”

Daniel rolled over on his bed mat and groaned. The morning sun
pounded on his aching head. He reached up to wipe the sleep from
his eyes but stopped. Blood—all over his hands, up to his elbows. He
flopped over onto his back and let his arms drop onto the dirt.
“Not again,” he mumbled. “Levi!”
The voice in his head remained silent.
Daniel dragged himself out of bed and stumbled toward the
pigs’ watering trough, squinting at the unforgiving sun.
“Out of the way,” he said to a pig, pushing it away with his
leg.
He submerged his arms in the water and scrubbed, muttering to
Levi the whole time. “Why do you do this to us? I liked it in Gergesa,
but because of you, we had to leave there. Then, in Kursi—I don’t
know what you killed, or who—but we almost ended up in prison
there. Now we have to leave Hippos. We’re running out of places in
the Decapolis to live.”
He finished washing and sat on the ground with his back
to the trough. He looked out over the small herd of swine and
winced.
“It’s just as well. I’m tired of this. Three years of working swine is
too much. I hate pigs. They are filthy, disgusting beasts. I want to get

back out on the water. Let’s move down to Ein Gev. They have fishing
boats there. Levi? Levi?”
“Ein Gev,” a voice said in his right ear.

Elric stood by himself against the back wall of John’s cave and
watched the other captains work. The ten of them pored over the war
map. Elric observed and listened. In the middle of the meeting, John
entered the cave with two scrolls tucked under his arm. Elric followed
him with his eyes. John’s two years of focus on the Word is beginning to
show. John now had a solid layer of light wrapped around his spirit,
and his spoken words and prayers had created a wall of glowing bricks
of light all around the war room. He passed through the middle of
the map and laid his scrolls next to all the others, and the captains
paid no notice to his presence in the Physical Realm. Elric smiled.
“It looks like it’s going to happen,” one of the captains said,
pointing to a region on the map, “despite our best efforts.”
Elric strained around the captains to see the map.
“The Egyptian false prophet has amassed a force of four thousand
followers and led them into the wilderness. He plans to take Jerusalem
by force starting at the Mount of Olives and liberate it from Roman
occupation.”
Elric shook his head. An unknowing tool of the enemy, this one is.
One of the other captains said, “And the Roman army is already
on its way to intercept them.”
Another unknowing tool of the enemy.

Swirling black clouds, flashes of light, and mixing layers of color
dominated one small portion of the war map. Elric covered his mouth
with his hand and shook his head.
So much destruction. So much pain.
“I know your day is close, Lord,” Elric whispered behind his
hand, “but could it not be closer?”

Daniel stepped off the fishing boat onto the shores by Capernaum
for the first time in four years. The fishing company he worked with in
Ein Gev had just opened a new trade market here at the far north end
of the lake, and they would be in port for the day, spend the night,
and then head back out before sunrise. Daniel looked up and down
the shore and in toward town. He reminisced about his days on the
fishing boats with Zebedee. It felt like a lifetime ago since that night
he fell off Zebedee’s boat, but here on the shore with the smell of fish
and the squawking birds, he knew not much had changed—not for
Capernaum, not for himself. Capernaum felt like home, although
a lost and distant one. He already decided what he would do after
finishing his duties on the dock. He would find some wine, get good
and numb, and go sit outside the synagogue where he hoped he could
find some quiet inside his head.
He passed through the streets, listening to people’s conversations.
Most of the talk revolved around the death of Caesar Augustus in
Rome and the new Caesar, Tiberius. Valerius Gratus had been
appointed the new procurator of Judea by Tiberius. None of people

seemed better off under the new leaders. Daniel caught little bits of
people’s conversations as he wove through the streets.
“I swear there is corruption at every level. Just the other day, I
actually had to pay a city official just to get my . . . ”
“Does it seem like there is more sickness these days? Every family

”
“Then he killed her. Of course, the officials don’t believe it, and
he is going to get away with it . . . ”
“Tax collectors. I hate them. They are filthy extortionists, every
one.”
Every conversation had the same dark tone. Daniel shook his
head and pretended not to hear. The talk didn’t sound any different
in Ein Gev. These are trying days everywhere.
Daniel decided he would get extra numb today before heading
back to Ein Gev tomorrow.

lric stood beside Lacidar at the entrance of the secret reading
place near John’s cave. Elric’s mouth dropped open, and his eyes
widened. “Look at this place,” he said to Lacidar.
What used to be only an alcove with high stone walls in the
Physical Realm had transformed into an impenetrable fortress of
light in the Middle Realm.
Elric crossed his arms. “I thought the stronghold around his cave
was impressive—but this . . . this is remarkable.”
Elric lifted his chin and took in a deep breath through his nose.
The sweet fragrance of the Spirit from the courts of the King made
him smile.

“The Spirit of the Lord is free to operate here unhindered,”
Lacidar said. “His presence is very strong.”
Elric looked over at John, deep in thought over a scroll containing
the prophet Isaiah’s writings. His uncut, sun–baked hair looked out
of control, and a short scruffy beard covered his cheeks and chin. He
appeared rough and weathered on the outside, but the armor around
his spirit pulsed with light.
“This is not the same naïve fifteen–year–old boy who fled from
the misfortune he experienced in his home in Judea nine years ago,”
Elric said.
“No, he is not,” Lacidar said. “His daily reading in the scrolls has
become serious studying. He devours them. He can’t get enough of
them. He reads them all day. Then he meditates on them most of the
night. Every waking moment is spent memorizing, contemplating,
rereading.”
“He is no longer detached,” Elric said.
“Good observation, Captain. He is in the middle of the heartbeat
of the Kingdom. The King speaks every word on the written page
directly to him.”
“Does he hear His voice?”
“No, but his spiritual ears are open. John asks the King questions,
and He answers plainly from the scrolls or speaks directly to his spirit.
Deep things—about His nature, His ways, His plans—they all well
up through the words into John’s spirit. The young, confused, angry,
and lonely John is gone. In his place is this hairy young man, filled
with joy, peace, and an intense hunger to know the King Himself.”
“Look,” Elric whispered to Lacidar. “John is praying for the
temple and for righteous leaders.”

“Just yesterday, in John’s cave, the regional captains were
discussing the new high priest, Caiaphas. He looks to be a powerful
instrument of the enemy, close to the Roman leadership and hungry
for political gain. The captains were discussing ways to counter his
influence and potentially raise up a different man. John must have
perceived it in the spirit.”
“Kai said he would eventually have discernment as deep as
Hannah,” Elric said.
“He is far beyond that. In fact, I think I have not seen anyone
with so strong an anointing since—Elijah.”
“I agree. We are close now. I believe John is almost ready to
receive his assignment from the Lord.”

Raziel sipped wine from his goblet and leaned against the outside

friends, the wedding celebration had spilled outside. Raziel found
a spot in the shade and watched the party. A musical group plucked
lively songs, and dozens of laughing, spinning dancers kicked up a

Mary bounced around the guests like a spirited puppy. “Did

eleven–year–old Rachael floated around and twirled with the music.
Raziel could see in her eyes the dream of the day when she would
get married like her big sister. Jesus approached from the side and
surprised him just as he took another sip.
“Thank you again for doing the ceremony,” Jesus said. “It was a
beautiful wedding.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t have missed it. This family is like a second
family to me.”
“Are we still meeting for a lesson tomorrow?”
“That is up to you. With all the festivities here today, I would
understand if you should need a day off.”
“I do not wish to miss a single day. I will already be up before
sunrise to pray. And I like to meditate on the lesson all day while I
work.”
“Very good. I will be here first thing in the morning. In the
meantime, I think I am going to go steal a dance with the bride.”
“Maybe I will do the same. After you, of course.”

Elric met with his lieutenants over the war map in John’s cave.
They all gazed into the map, and Jenli finished his report on the
progress of his six assignments of the inner twelve.
“But, overall, I would say that these six are similar to Zaben’s
six—they seem to have a heart for the King, but they do not appear

512

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

to be warriors. If they are to become generals in the King’s army, they
still have a long way to go.”
“I am not worried,” Timrok said. “We have all seen the King use
the most unlikely servants to accomplish His purposes.”
Zaben pointed to a spot on the map. “Captain, what do we
know about this new procurator of Judea?”
“His name is Pontius Pilate,” Elric said. “Another puppet of the
enemy. He is no friend of Herod Antipas, but it appears he and the
high priest, Caiaphas, have formed a close alliance already.”
“A dangerous coalition,” Zaben said, biting his lip.
“No more dangerous than Valerius Gratus and Caiaphas,” Jenli
said.
Elric nodded. “Caiaphas has been in place for a long time now.
The enemy has found one who serves their objectives.”
The sound of sobbing from across the room caught their
attention. Elric turned. That’s John. Elric motioned with his hand,
and the war map faded away.
“What is happening with John?” Elric asked. “The last few times
I have seen him, he has been weeping.” Elric paused a moment and
watched John. “And this is not the weeping of emotional sadness.
There is something deep at work.”
Lacidar smiled and did a little hop. “Twelve years in the
wilderness has marked another turning point for John. It is amazing
to watch. I am so thankful to have this assignment.”
He did another little hop. “I have never seen a person draw so
close to the King. I know Moses and David did. But I have not seen
one like this since Enoch. John is completely caught up in knowing
the King. Not His power or His works or His blessings. He just wants

to know Him. It is a complete abandon. And, of course, when an
earthly man draws that close to the King Himself . . . ”
Jenli said, “He becomes acutely aware of his own sinful state.”
“He weeps like this for hours,” Lacidar said. “At first it was just
for himself, but lately he has been weeping over Israel, the temple,
the priests. Sometimes it seems like he feels the weight of the entire
world.”
“We are so close,” Elric said.

Six months later, Elric raced from his post in Nazareth to John’s
secret alcove. He blasted through the fortress of light and landed
in the center of the courtyard. His wings folded away, and he said,
“Grigor brought word for me to—” He stopped and looked around.
Lacidar pounded out a jubilant melody on his resonar. The sound
bounced around the walls of light and formed visible waves of joy
in the spiritual air. All five of Lacidar’s warriors danced to the tune,
leaping high into the air, spinning and flipping and laughing and
shouting.
“Captain!” Lacidar said. He stopped playing, set his resonar
aside, and stood up.
“Grigor said I should come quickly,” Elric said.
“We believe the Lord is about to commission the prophet,”
Lacidar said with a beaming smile. “John has come to a new place.
For the last several years, he had been so focused on simply spending
time with the King that he had buried the lessons of his father along

with pains of his memories. But then, the Lord reminded him of
things Zacharias had told him in his youth, and all those lessons
came flooding back. John dove back into the scrolls, this time looking
specifically for signs of the Messiah. For the last six months, John has
searched the pages, and everywhere he looked, there was only one
thing he could see—the Messiah is coming. He is so caught up in
thoughts of the Messiah that—”
Waves of light boomed through the roof of the fortress. The air
became thick with the sweet fragrance of the Spirit. Elric, Lacidar,
and the five warriors dropped to their knees. The waves coalesced
into visible words and rolled over John. His spirit absorbed them like
a sponge.
“The Messiah is coming,” the words said. “The time is now.”
“Now? Now?” John cried out. “But have you seen your people?
They’re not ready. Their hearts are hard and filled with evil. They are
not ready.”
“They need someone to prepare the way. That someone is you,
John. I am sending you before my Son to prepare the hearts of the
people.”
“Yes!” John shouted, “Yes, Lord, send me. Something has to be
done. You cannot walk amongst us in your holiness when our hearts
are so far from You. I will deliver whatever message you have for your
people.”
“Teach them what it means to repent. Call them to turn away
from sin. Tell them the Kingdom of God is near. I will be with you. I
will put my Word in your mouth.”
The air became quiet. The Word of the Lord had finished.

“Yes!” Elric shouted. He unfurled his wings and shot straight
up, spinning and shouting “yes” all the way to the high ceiling of the
fortress. Lacidar resumed his song, and his five warriors bounded into
a dance. Elric swooped back down and locked arms with the other
dancers. While John sat in quiet prayer, the angels danced and sang
with wild abandon.
***
Elric joined the meeting of the regional captains the next
day. Rather than standing alone in the back and listening to the
proceedings like he usually did, he stepped up to the war map and
turned around to face the others. The other captains stepped back
and crossed their arms. One motioned with his hand, and the war
map disappeared. Twenty lieutenants lined the walls in rows, and the
ones in the back strained their heads around the ones in front. No
one moved. No one made a sound. Elric could feel every anxious eye
on him. He knew they knew he worked a secret mission for the King,
and the anticipation of what he might have to say could be seen on
every one of their faces.
“Friends, I bring exciting news that I know you have all
been waiting for.” He paused a moment, heavy with the
enormity of his message. “The King is going to be revealed soon.”
The room erupted in celebration. Every angel in the room
leapt and shouted. Unrestrained dancing filled the room. Elric stood
motionless in the middle of the cave, and the captains and
lieutenants spun around him and did flips over him. He laughed

and let the festivity continue for several minutes, but then lifted
both hands in the air and raised his voice over the mayhem.
“However,” he shouted. He waved his arms to get their attention.
Some started to settle down.
“But we do not know exactly when, yet,” he said.
Most of the dancing stopped. Everyone became quiet. Bright
smiles covered every face, and they all continued to bounce with
excited energy.
“What I do know is this. The prophet John has just received his
commission to begin his campaign. He will move out immediately. I
suspect we have about a year to prepare. John’s charge is to deliver a
message of repentance. Our job—your job—is to get people out to
hear him. Spread the word across the whole region as quickly as you
can. We must reach at least as far as northern Galilee and, of course,
all of Judea. We will begin with some outlying villages around the
Jordan, and once he starts gathering some disciples and word starts to
spread, we will settle in the wilderness by the Jordan.”
One of the other captains stepped forward. “Will the people we
bring in become the army for the Lord that we will lead into battle
against the enemy?”
Elric looked down at his foot and used it to scuff some dirt
around. His voice became low and serious. “There is much about my
mission that continues to remain a mystery. I would have expected
by now that we would have identified the valiant men to be all the
generals and captains. We do have a dozen men we are preparing
for His inner circle. But unfortunately, beyond this, the King has
remained unusually quiet about His plans. I have no instructions
about an army.”

I obviously need to find a city. Maybe I should go directly
to Jerusalem. Maybe I should go and preach in the temple itself.
The thought of preaching in the temple felt a little unnerving,
but the Word of the Lord had lit such a fire inside that he knew he
could stand on the steps of the inner courts and declare his message
before the chief priests and rulers if given the chance. John looked
around at the empty wilderness outside his cave. He laughed to

years. He looked down the canyon toward the Jordan and back again.
Then, he took a deep breath and started walking toward the Jordan.
He wandered for two days, staying within an easy walk to the
water. On the third day, he saw the first sign of civilization. A small
village.
They probably don’t even have a synagogue. Still, I should stop here

There are several houses over there. I wonder how I am to know where to go.

Lacidar approached the town by the Jordan with John walking

“It looks like our man is in place and ready,” Lacidar said. “Today,
you will meet a man named Lon and begin your mission.”
Lacidar turned and spoke directly to John, “Turn up this trail

“Hello, stranger,” Lon called out to a hairy man approaching on
a trail by his house. Lon was an older man with a peppery beard and
calloused hands.

520

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

“Hello,” the man called back. “My name is John.”
“Shalom. I am Lon.” He eyed this strange looking man with long
wild hair, a camel skin garment with a leather belt, tough weathered
skin, and covered in dust, “You look like you could use refreshing.
Could I offer you some water?”
John fidgeted with his belt and rubbed his hands through his
matted hair. “Yes,” he said without making eye contact. “That would
be very kind.”
Lon paused a moment to look at John. His wild appearance and
tentative mannerisms gave Lon the sense that he might be the first
person this stranger had spoken with in a very long time. “I’ll be right
back,” he said. Lon backed away and turned toward his house.
Lon re-emerged from his front door with a large cup filled with
water. “What brings you to our little town?”
John looked down at the ground and shuffled his feet. He tried
to straighten his hair. He took a drink of water. “I am, uh . . . traveling
around to, uh . . . people need to know that . . . ”
Lon cocked his head and examined this stranger from the
wilderness, trying to decide if he was just a crazy vagrant.
John continued, “The Messiah is coming. The Kingdom of the
Lord is at hand.”
Lon cocked his head the other direction. “Are you some kind of
prophet?”
“Oh, I don’t know about that. I just know that the Messiah is
about to be revealed, and we all need to get ready.”
This wild–looking man certainly looked like a crazy vagrant.
But something burned on the inside of Lon that he couldn’t explain.
Something told him he needed to hear more of what this man had
to say.

THE WORD RELEASED

521

“Go on.”
“The Messiah is the Son of God Himself, awesome in holiness
and righteous in judgments. Before He arrives, we need to prepare
ourselves. We need to repent from our evil ways and turn to Him.
This is the Word of the Lord to our generation.”
Lon’s heart became ablaze. He never thought of himself as an
“evil” man. In fact, he always believed himself to be a basically good
person. He knew he didn’t live as righteously as the priests and Levites,
but he worked hard for his family, never stole or defrauded anyone,
and attended synagogue fairly regularly. But something within his
inner being knew that if he had to stand before the righteous Judge
and account for his every thought and deed, he would surely come up
short. The thought that the Messiah Himself was drawing near shook
him to his core. His hidden sins—times that he had lied, had impure
thoughts, had occasional angry outbursts—flashed across his mental
ledger and left him feeling dirty and exposed. How could this stranger
have known all these things about him? How could he have known
that, under his façade of decent normalcy, there hid an incomplete
soul that longed to be truly clean? Why was the very presence of this
man unraveling his whole existence? He needed to hear more.
“This is,” Lon said, struggling to get his heart out of his throat.
“A strong word. You must be hungry. Why not come into my home
and tell me more? We will prepare supper.”
Lon’s wife worked on the meal while stealing glances of the
conversation over her shoulder. Lon offered John some wine.
“Please do not be offended,” John said, “but I must regretfully
decline. You see, I have taken the Nazirite vow.”
“Oh.” Lon nodded. “That would explain the—”

“Hair? Yes, it has not been cut from birth. I suppose I do look
a little—”
“No, no, not at all.”
They both laughed.
John surged like a fountain all evening. His initial apprehensive
conversation turned into a torrent of spiritual water. Entire passages
of Scriptures stitched together into a story of the coming Messiah,
the holiness of God, and need for His righteousness. He taught about
what it means to repent—how true repentance starts with brokenness
and remorse, an honest admission of guilt, a turning away from the
sin, and a turning toward God for mercy. Every word he spoke pierced
deep into Lon’s heart.
“Seek the Lord while He may be found,” John urged. “Call
upon Him while He is near. Let the wicked abandon his way and
the unrighteous person his thoughts. And let him return to the Lord,
and He will have compassion on him, and to our God, for He will
abundantly pardon.”
***
Lacidar, Jaeden, and Ry knelt at the other end of the room of
Lon’s house while John and Lon talked. The angels hadn’t lifted their
eyes once from the time John started speaking. The presence of the
King rested so strong in the room, the warriors would have thought
the King Himself spoke the words.
By the time John finished, Lon and his wife wept tears of true
repentance. John prayed with them, and their tears became tears of joy.
Lacidar turned to Jaeden and Ry and said, “Salvation has come
to this house tonight. I can’t wait to see what will happen tomorrow.”

again, his stomach wouldn’t allow him to eat more than half the portion.
The fish for breakfast seemed a little better, but even still, John only
nibbled at it to be polite.

Lon bounced around and chattered like a man just released from
prison. “And the first thing we’ll do is gather up all the men from my
village—you can wait here and relax—and then you can tell all them
the same message. And then we will go to another village. There is
523

one very close. I know many of the men there. They need to hear it,
too.”
“How far are we from Jerusalem?”
“Oh, not too far. Good heavens, there are at least five towns
within an easy walk from here. We should travel to all of them. They
all need to hear this. You sit here and finish your breakfast. I’m too
excited to eat any more. I’m going to go now and get the men from
my village. No, no—sit down. I will be back in less than an hour.”
Lon returned with no less than thirty men ranging from a
bright–eyed teenager to the senior elder who needed help to make the
walk. With the small group gathered outside his house, Lon stepped
up next to John in front of his house. “And here he is, the prophet I
told you about. His name is John.” He turned to John and said, “Go
ahead, go ahead.”
This is more people than I’ve seen in over a decade. They all stared
at him as though they expected some kind of show. How do I just start
talking to a group of people I don’t even know? I don’t know what to say.
I’m not ready for this.
Something within him stirred—just deliver the message. Take a
step of faith. Just start.
“The Messiah is coming,” John blurted out. “He is very near. We
need to prepare our hearts to receive Him.”
Passages of Scriptures flashed into his mind, and words came
bubbling out as though a river flowed out of his belly. He spoke the
words as they came, and the more he spoke, the more they came.
What is happening? These men are truly being moved! Most of them
were weeping. I don’t have eloquent speech, but . . . But somehow the
message cut through and laid the men’s hearts bare.

“What do we need to do?” they cried.
“Repent. Confess your sins. Turn to God.”
“Yes, yes!” they all said.
There needs to be something more. A sign to demonstrate that
they have made a change. Some kind of physical act they could do to
commemorate their commitment.
He paused. He looked around. The Jordan. I have an idea.
“Everybody, follow me,” he shouted. He stepped through the
group and headed toward the Jordan.
They made the short march to the river. John gathered them
beside the bank, and he waded in up to his waist. He called Lon in to
join him. He smiled and put his hand on Lon’s shoulder.
“If you have truly repented and want to be cleansed, we are going
to do it right here in the river. I will immerse you under the water as a
sign that you have repented of your sin, and as you come back up out
of the water, it will be a sign that your sins have been washed clean.
Remember, it is not me who forgives sin, and it is not the water itself.
So, as you do this, pray to the God of Heaven for mercy, for it is He
alone who can forgive.”
Turning to Lon, he said, “Are you ready?”
“Yes, yes. I can’t wait.”
***
The men outside Lon’s house were awash in light in the Middle
Realm. Every word from the prophet John’s mouth broke over the
men like tidal waves of light. Beams of light from the Throne shone
down and mixed with the spiritual energy. Lacidar and his team stood
to the side and watched with amazement.

“Everybody, follow me,” John shouted. He started walking.
“He’s headed for the Jordan,” Lacidar said. “Ry, go find Elric and
bring him here. The rest of you, move out to the river.”
Within moments, Elric alighted beside Lacidar on the bank of
the Jordan. A moment later, Timrok, Zaben, and Jenli showed up.
Lacidar’s five warriors stood in a line on the opposite side of the river,
watching John and scanning for enemy activity. Elric and the four
lieutenants watched John in the river without saying a word. Their
mouths hung open, and their arms hung limp.
The last man came up out of the water.
Elric crossed his arms and said, “It has begun.”
***
Baptism minus 1.5 years
Six months after John’s first baptisms, Elric and Lacidar positioned
themselves on an overlook north of the Dead Sea at Bethany beyond
the Jordan and gazed over the activities below.
“This is a perfect location for John’s home camp,” Elric said.
“Easy access to the river, and these surrounding hills are like an
amphitheater for the people coming to hear his message.”
Lacidar nodded. “Yes, and the people are responding in droves.
Hundreds are being baptized in the Jordan every day. From all over
Judea, Jerusalem. People are coming in from as far away as Galilee.”
John stood at the banks of the river and preached to the crowd
sitting and standing on the hillside. His booming voice echoed off the
hills and resounded up to Elric and Lacidar. “‘Do I take any pleasure
in the death of the wicked,’ declares the Lord God. ‘rather than that

he would turn from his ways and live? Repent and turn away from
all your offenses, so that wrongdoing does not become a stumbling
block to you. Hurl away from you all your offenses which you have
committed and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! For
why should you die, house of Israel? For I take no pleasure in the
death of anyone who dies,’ declares the Lord God. ‘Therefore, repent
and live!’”
“He speaks with great power,” Elric said.
“He has the Word of the Lord. The authority of his message
is like nothing any of these people have ever seen, and it is causing
thousands to travel here to hear this man in the wilderness.”
“I know John had his heart set on preaching in Jerusalem,”
Elric said. “Did you have difficulty leading him to stay here in the
wilderness?”
“No, sir. It was easy. I only needed to suggest that Lon take
John to the other local villages, and Lon took charge. He was already
excited about doing it. They went to the first village with Lon and ten
others from his village. The reception there was dramatic. When they
left that village for another, another ten men joined the group. By the
time they made it to the fifth town, word had begun to spread, and
John had an entourage of nearly a hundred men. After preaching in
two more towns, it became clear to John that he needed to set up a
home base and let the people come to him. We have been here since
then.”
“Is there any indication that these who are coming can be
mobilized for the King’s army?”
“Most come and hear and are baptized—and then return to their
lives. They leave with a fresh start and anticipation about the coming

528

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Messiah. Many, though, stay with John and become his disciples. At
night John teaches them in depth about the King who is coming and
who will deliver them and judge the nations of the earth.”
“Is John, then, preparing their hearts for battle?”
“No. His disciples do update him on all that is going on in the
world since he entered the wilderness. The state of things is worse
than he knew, and it adds fuel to the fire in his message. He speaks out
against corruption in the government and the temple. He lambasts
the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and priests. He even condemns the evil
deeds of Roman rulers. But in all of it, he is after the hearts of the
unrighteous, not a revolutionary army.”
“I see our battle is heated,” Elric said, looking out over the
hillsides.
A fiery battlefield spread out before them. Open skirmishes
covered the entire area in the Middle Realm. The elzurim fought
to drive away the determined demons, but it was a never–ending
struggle.
“There are so many beaelzurim,” Elric muttered. “And they’re as
unrelenting as flies.”
One demon cupped his leathery hands over a man’s ears. Another
spoke a stream of lies to a group of men. Another put heckling words
into the mouth of another man. One by one, the elzurim chased the
demons away, but they returned again and again, clouding the minds
of the people and disrupting John’s message to them.
Lacidar said, “Yes. My team stays around John to protect him.
The other warriors have their own assignments and are fighting hard.”
A group of Pharisees gathered and listened to John. They talked
amongst themselves, stroking their beards and shooting derisive

JOHN THE BAPTIZER

529

glances at John and the crowd. Several lying beaelzurim worked in
their midst.
Elric said, “These Pharisees are not here to receive the Word of
the Lord, but to test John and promote themselves.”
“Yes, sir. But John usually has a strong word for them.”
John’s voice echoed across the hills. “You brood of vipers, who
warned you to flee from the wrath to come?”
“Here it is,” Lacidar said.
John pointed at the group of Pharisees. “Therefore bear fruits in
keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We
have Abraham for our father,’ for I say to you that from these stones
God is able to raise up children to Abraham. Indeed the axe is already
laid at the root of the trees; so every tree that does not bear good fruit
is cut down and thrown into the fire.”
The rest of the crowd cried out, “Then what shall we do?”
He answered, “The man who has two tunics is to share with him
who has none; and he who has food is to do likewise.”
Some tax collectors who came to be baptized said to him,
“Teacher, what shall we do?”
And he said to them, “Collect no more than what you have been
ordered to.”
Some soldiers questioned him, saying, “And what about us, what
shall we do?”
And he said to them, “Do not take money from anyone by force,
or accuse anyone falsely, and be content with your wages.”
Many of the people came forward for John to baptize them.
Elric smiled. “Even with all the enemy resistance,” he said, “when the
Word of the Lord is spoken, the hearts of men respond.”

“Expectations are growing,” Lacidar said. “People are beginning
to wonder—could this man actually be the Messiah?”
Elric crossed his arms and took a breath. “Once the King is

T

he wedding party at Mary’s house drew to a close late at night.
Many had come to celebrate her youngest daughter Rachael’s
marriage, and most of them stayed until the very end. Raziel

stood by himself against the wall and watched the family and all their
friends. His eyes sparkled, and a proud grin spread across his face. I
feel such a connection with this family. I am proud and honored to have
officiated the marriage of six of Mary’s children now.

Before the ceremony, Raziel thought Mary seemed melancholy
and disappointed that Joseph didn’t get to see Rachael grow up and
see how radiant she looked on this special day. But now, Mary smiled
531

532

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

and laughed and carried on with cheerful small talk. Raziel smiled.
Jesus, though, seems more preoccupied and introspective. I wonder what
is going on with Him.
Jesus said goodnight to some departing guests, joined Raziel,
and watched the others still milling about.
“What’s the matter?” Raziel asked. “It is an exciting day for your
baby sister.”
“Yes, it is,” Jesus said with a smile. “I am very happy.”
“What is it, then?”
Jesus paused and looked around at the guests who still lingered.
His thoughts are in another place—a weightier place, a place of
destiny and purpose.
“I am thirty now. And the last of my mother’s children are on
their own. My responsibilities to my family are complete. The time
has finally come for me to begin my real work.”
“I knew this day would come.” Raziel said. He paused a moment.
He looked Jesus in the eyes. “I know who you are,” he said in a secret
whisper.
This was the first time this had been said out loud. Raziel had
always distanced himself from the subject and concentrated on
doing his best to teach Jesus everything he could, to protect Him
from inquisitive eyes, and to be a good mentor. In the latter years,
it had become more and more difficult because the student had far
surpassed the teacher.
Jesus smiled and looked deep into Raziel’s eyes. “I know you do.
You have given me much. Your reward will be great in my Father’s
kingdom.”
“How will you begin? Where will you go first?”

“There is a prophet preaching in the wilderness by the Jordan.”
“I have heard of him. His name is John?”
“Yes. He has been preparing the way for me. I must go there
first.”
“What about your mother?”
“She will stay with James for a while. Eventually, though, I will
come back and bring her with me.”
“I know I’m too old and not skilled with weapons of war—but
when you build your army, will you let me serve with you? I have a
strong heart and a great zeal for the Kingdom of God.”
Jesus laughed out loud and grabbed Raziel by the shoulders. Out
of the corner of his eye, Raziel caught the festive sight of the bride and
groom opening a wedding gift. Jesus looked over at the gift opening
and then back at Raziel.
“The Kingdom of God is like a precious gift that is wrapped. A
man does not know what he has until the gift is completely opened.”
“Ha!” Raziel said with a satisfied grin. “The student speaks to the
teacher in riddles. I shall take that as a ‘yes.’”

Timrok stepped up from behind Elric and stood beside him on
the hill overlooking the prophet John’s base at the Jordan.
“Captain, the King has set up camp just behind us. It appears
He intends to wait until tomorrow to reveal Himself to John.”
Elric continued his gaze over the area where John worked his
mission.

534

CROSS INTENTS: THE BAPTISM

Timrok said, “My team is in place around the Lord’s encampment.
Zaben and Jenli’s teams have an outer perimeter. All is quiet.”
Elric continued his gaze without a single movement.
“The King’s generals?” Elric asked.
“Simon and Andrew, James and John, Philip, Bartholomew—
they have been here for weeks, being discipled by John.”
Elric continued his gaze. “This is it,” Elric said. “This is the place.
Tomorrow is the day. We have waited a long time to see this day.” A
tear welled up and rolled down his cheek. He didn’t reach up to wipe
it away.
Elric and Timrok stood in silence and watched the battlefield
below. Warriors in white fought relentless demons over the minds of
men while John preached the good news of the coming Kingdom of
God.
Elric and Timrok’s attention turned to a group of priests and
Levites from Jerusalem who approached the river’s bank to challenge
John.
“Who are you?” one of the priests called out. “Are you the
Christ?”
“I am not the Christ,” John said.
“What then? are you Elijah?”
“I am not.”
“Are you the Prophet?”
“No.”
“Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent
us? What do you say about yourself?”
“I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the
way of the Lord,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.”

“Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor
Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
“As for me, I baptize in water for repentance, but He who is
coming after me is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandal I am
not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and
fire. His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear
His threshing floor; and He will gather His wheat into the barn, but
He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
Timrok’s hands moved to his swords’ handles.
“Tomorrow,” Elric said.

The sun stood directly overhead on the day of the King’s
revelation. Elric’s team moved onto the battlefield near the banks of
the Jordan. John finished his morning message and stood waist-deep
in the water. Elric led the march, followed by Zaben, Timrok, Lacidar,
and Jenli in two columns. Behind the lieutenants, in two columns,
followed their teams—twenty gleaming warriors in white. Each angel
had his sword out resting against his shoulder in parade array. All
combatants in the Middle Realm stopped and turned their attention
to Elric’s march. The spiritual air became silent. Every spiritual eye,
elzur and beaelzur, fixed on them. Elric reached the water’s edge. He
halted. The squad behind him halted in step. The two columns faced
inward and took two steps back, forming a corridor between them.
In the Physical Realm, the day appeared to be like any other.
Men milled around on the hillsides and talked about John’s message.

536

Some men made their way toward the riverbank to be baptized. Those
preparing to be baptized removed their outer tunics.
From among the crowd Jesus stepped forward toward the river.
He walked straight toward John, through the lane formed by Elric’s
warriors. Halfway down the lane, He stopped and reached for the
bottom of His protective cloak, the outer tunic made by Mary from
Elric’s cloth that He had worn every day. He pulled the garment up
over His head and slid it off. The instant He removed the cloak, His
divine spirit became visible to all the beaelzurim. He flashed like the
sun, and every spirit—angel and demon—fell on their face. Elric’s
team stayed at attention but bowed their heads.
In the water, John gasped for air and grabbed his heart. He
looked up, and his eyes met Jesus’. His knees buckled, and he almost
fell over. Jesus stepped into the water and stood before John.
John struggled to breathe. He swallowed hard and said with a
cracking voice, “I . . . have need to be baptized by You, and do You
come to me?”
“Permit it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill
all righteousness.”
“Yes, Lord. At your word.”
John reached his hand out toward Jesus’ back but then pulled
away and averted his eyes.
Jesus smiled and said, “John.”
John lifted his eyes and reached out with his hand again. Again,
he hesitated. Then he touched Jesus’ back. No explosion happened—
no sparks, no flash of light, no sound. He paused a moment and took
several breaths. In one swift motion, he submerged Jesus under the
water and pulled Him back up.

Jesus emerged from the water, and the sky in the Middle Realm
split from horizon to horizon. A blast of light from the Throne room
exploded over the area. The Spirit of God descended through the
light in the bodily form of a dove and alighted on Jesus.
Booming across the heavens, a voice from the Throne said, “This
is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
Every demon in the area shrieked. They all scrambled to their
feet, bolted like frightened rabbits, took to the sky, and fled as fast as
they could. The angels all lay prostrate before the King.
The men in the Physical Realm continued talking and milling
around.
The dove remained on Jesus. In a brilliant flash of light, the dove
merged into Jesus’ spirit, and He became even brighter in the Middle
Realm.
A moment later, the sky closed up, and silence fell over the valley.
Elric turned with squinting eyes, and there in the river stood
two men, John and Jesus. Jesus’ spirit blazed with light, but in the
Physical Realm, He looked no different. Jesus smiled at John and
grasped his shoulder. He turned and walked back to the shore. He
passed through Elric’s columns of warriors, picked up His tunic,
and continued walking toward His camp. Without an order, Elric’s
twenty warriors did a facing maneuver and marched off with Jesus,
surrounding Him as they went.
The lieutenants gathered around Elric.
“Captain?” Jenli said.
Elric stood motionless with his eyes to the heavens. “Where are
His Mighty Ones? Where is Michael?”
“Had you received word to expect them?” Jenli asked.

“No, but I thought . . . ”
Zaben bit his lip and said, “Even now, His full plan remains a
mystery.”
Timrok scanned the horizons for incoming enemy forces. “The
King has been revealed. Every spirit on the planet knows where He is
now. If Michael and the Mighty Ones do not appear soon, I think we
shall not be able to withstand the attack.”
“I don’t think they are coming,” Zaben said.
“Who?” Timrok said with a puzzled look.
“The enemy.”
Timrok gave an incredulous scowl.
“You saw them when His spirit was revealed,” Zaben said. “They
cannot withstand the glory of the King, and they know it. Before,
when His spirit was hidden, they may have deluded themselves into
thinking they could reach Him. But now . . .”
“I agree,” said Elric. “I do not know the enemy’s next move, but
a frontal attack seems unlikely.”
“What are our orders, then, Captain?” Timrok said. “Until now,
our objective has been to keep the King hidden.”
Elric rubbed his chin and looked upward. His left eye twitched
twice. “Until we receive a new word from the throne, we continue
our present course.”
He put one hand on Lacidar’s shoulder and his other on Timrok’s
shoulder. He clenched his jaw and took a deep breath. “Nothing has
changed. We protect the King. We protect the prophet John. We
develop the King’s inner twelve. Only now, we do it in full view of
the enemy.”
Timrok smiled and put his hands on his sword handles. “In His
service.”

has none; and he who has food is to do likewise.” And
some tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said
to him, “Teacher, what shall we do?” And he said to them,
“Collect no more than what you have been ordered to.”
Some soldiers were questioning him, saying, “And what
about us, what shall we do?” And he said to them, “Do
not take money from anyone by force, or accuse anyone
falsely, and be content with your wages.”
Chapter 62
John 1:19–23 (nasb1995): This is the testimony of John, when the
Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask
him, “Who are you?” And he confessed and did not deny, but
confessed, “I am not the Christ.” They asked him, “What then?
Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?”
And he answered, “No.” Then they said to him, “Who are you,
so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do
you say about yourself?” He said, “I am a voice of one crying
in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’
as Isaiah the prophet said.”
Matthew 3:11–12 (nasb1995): “As for me, I baptize you with water
for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than
I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals; He will baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in His
hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He

will gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the
chaff with unquenchable fire.”
Matthew 3:13–15 (nasb1995): Then Jesus arrived from Galilee at the
Jordan coming to John, to be baptized by him. But John tried
to prevent Him, saying, “I have need to be baptized by You,
and do You come to me?” But Jesus answering said to him,
“Permit it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill
all righteousness.”
Matthew 3:17 (nasb1995): and behold, a voice out of the heavens
said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.”

AUTHOR’S NOTE

NOW WHAT?

T

he primary angelic characters in this story are fictional, and
the specific actions they carry out are the simple musings of a
single man. However, the underlying battle for the throne of

the universe and the individual souls of mankind is real. Whether we
know it or even believe it, we are embroiled in a perilous struggle that
stretches from ancient times to the present day. All around us spiritual
forces struggle for the hearts of men. The good news is that the King is
and always has been working His plan for the redemption of man. This
is the amazing story found throughout the Scriptures.

Because of sin, man is separated from God and enslaved to
spiritual forces of darkness. The only payment for sin that will satisfy
the righteousness of God is death. This is the primary issue facing
every person who has ever lived—how can we ever hope to stand
before a holy Creator with any, even one, sin on the ledger of our
life? If we were left on our own, our situation would be desperately
hopeless indeed.
But God did not leave us in our impossible condition. According
to His plan, He Himself entered the world, lived as a man, and lived a
sinless life as only He could. Then, He took all the sins of all mankind

upon Himself and paid the price to satisfy the law of sin and death.
The spiritual forces of darkness did not win a victory by killing
Him—rather it was always His intent to take our place in death so
He could offer us life while still satisfying His holiness. This is the
greatest story of good news imaginable. Instead of facing the eternal
wrath of God, He has provided a way for us to be set free from the
bondage of sin, enter His Kingdom as beloved children, and live with
Him in glory forever.
So how do we step from darkness into light? The scriptures make
it clear that there is no work we can do to earn His righteousness.
Only His perfect blood can cleanse us. All we need to do is simply
believe with our heart that Jesus’ death and resurrection provide the
way to God and confess with our mouth that Jesus is Lord, and we
will be saved. When we put our faith in Him, our spirits that were
dead because of sin become alive to God, His very Spirit takes up
residence within our mortal bodies, and He transfers us into the
Kingdom of light.
If you’re not sure what you believe about Jesus, I challenge you
seek the truth. Get a Bible and read it for yourself. Start with the
Gospel of John and ask the King of Heaven to reveal Himself to you.
Angels are fun to think about, and hopefully my story provides a
different view of Jesus’ life and work on earth, but do not focus on the
angels themselves. The real story is about how God Himself came to
make a way for us to reach Him. He accomplished His intent. Now
you need to decide what you are going to do about the cross.
