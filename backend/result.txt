Conclusion
About the Authors

“Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
To those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion
in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to
Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood:
May grace and peace be multiplied to you.”
1 Peter 1:1–2

INTRODUCTION
Such an interesting way to start a letter: “To those who are elect exiles …”
Writing in the early 60s AD, Simon Peter addressed his message to Christians who were
living in parts of the first-century Middle East. He called his readers “elect
exiles of the Dispersion,” which means “chosen ones scattered about.”
Sound familiar? It should. Because those of us who follow Jesus
are exiles, chosen by God and scattered about—though perhaps we
don’t always think of ourselves that way. Most of us haven’t been overtly

persecuted for following Jesus, pushed out of our homes, or threatened
with death for not renouncing our faith. Peter, on the other hand, experienced all those things
and, a few short years after penning this letter, was executed by the Roman emperor Nero.

Exiles:

The Bible refers to
Christians as exiles in
the world because they
no longer belong to the
world; they belong to
the kingdom of God and
are therefore “citizens
of heaven” (Phil. 3:20).
“[Jesus] prayed, ‘I am
coming to you now, but
I say these things while
I am still in the world, so
that [my followers] may
have the full measure of
my joy within them. I have
given them your word
and the world has hated
them, for they are not
of the world any more
than I am of the world.
My prayer is not that
you take them out of
the world but that you
protect them from the evil
one. They are not of the
world, even as I am not
of it. Sanctify them by the
truth; your word is truth.
As you sent me into
the world, I have sent
them into the world. For
them I sanctify myself,
that they too may be
truly sanctified.’”
John 17:13–19
(NIV)

God’s Goodness for the Chosen

But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, because before he died,
Peter lived in a way we should try to emulate. He wasn’t perfect,
as The Chosen often depicts, but he was firmly established in his
faith—and it started with fish. Or, more accurately, an enormous
lack thereof.
“When [Jesus] had finished speaking, he said to Simon,
‘Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.’
And Simon answered, ‘Master, we toiled all night

and took nothing! But at your word I will let down
the nets.’ And when they had done this, they enclosed a
large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. They
signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and
help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so
that they began to sink. But when Simon Peter saw it,
he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, ‘Depart from me,
for I am a sinful man!’ … And Jesus said to Simon, ‘Do
not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.’
And when they had brought their boats to land,
they left everything and followed him.”
Luke 5:4–11
Consider this: Before Jesus filled Peter’s boat with fish, there
were no fish. Meaning, a professional fisherman was out all night
on a fish-filled sea and caught nothing. NOTHING. And then
Jesus filled his boat with so many fish, Peter couldn’t haul them
all in without help. Which means the miracle of the fish, as it’s
come to be known, was made possible because of the miracle

Introduction

of the lack of fish. The lack was a momentary suffering that was
ultimately eclipsed by the bigger thing God was doing.
As a result, Peter surrendered to Jesus as Lord. Boom. Done.
Except nothing is ever truly that simple, is it? Because things
got a lot harder for Peter after he gave his life to Jesus. Following
required him to leave his home and wife for long periods of time.
It required him to minister to and serve needy people every day,
no matter how he felt. It required him to live with little to no
money. Or plans. Or control. Or even a complete understanding
of some of the things Jesus was saying and doing.
Add to that the fierce cultural resistance of his day, jealous
and dangerous religious leaders, false accusations, persistent
persecution, and the ongoing oppression from Rome … and you
end up with Christ crucified and ten out of the twelve apostles
turned into martyrs. Interestingly, one of Peter’s last interactions
with Jesus was almost identical to his first.
Only this time, it included a warning.
“Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the
shore; yet the disciples did not know that it
was Jesus. Jesus said to them, ‘Children, do you
have any fish?’ They answered him, ‘No.’ He
said to them, ‘Cast the net on the right side
of the boat, and you will find some.’ So they
cast it, and now they were not able to haul it
in, because of the quantity of fish. [John] said
to Peter, ‘It is the Lord!’ When Simon Peter
heard that it was the Lord, he … threw himself

Who Want
to Know
We know that Simon Peter
lived in Capernaum (Mark 1:21–
29), where he was a fisherman
with his brother Andrew (Matt.
4:18; Mark 1:16), and that he
was married (Matt. 8:14; Mark
1:30; Luke 4:38).
Simon is described in the New
Testament as being an overly
confident man who seemed to
think he could earn his worth
and who sometimes spoke with
little forethought (Matt. 16:21–
23; 26:31–35, 69–75). Luke’s
gospel actually makes note
of such a moment, remarking
after a statement made by
Simon, “not knowing what he
said” (Luke 9:33).
Regardless, Jesus still called
him to follow (Luke 5:1–11) and
was patient with him (22:31–
32). Simon Peter became a
key leader among the twelve
apostles (Acts 1–12), bedrock
preacher of the early church
(Matt. 16:18), writer of two
New Testament books of the
Bible (1 and 2 Pet.), healer of
the sick and lame (Acts 5:15),
and fearless unto death (John
21:15–19).

into the sea. The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of
fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.
When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish
laid out on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, ‘Bring some of the fish that
you have just caught.’ So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net
ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many,
the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, ‘Come and have breakfast.’ …
When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, ‘Simon, son of
John, do you love me more than these?’ He said to him, ‘Yes, Lord; you know
that I love you.’ He said to him, ‘Feed my lambs.’ He said to him a second time,
‘Simon, son of John, do you love me?’ He said to him, ‘Yes, Lord; you know
that I love you.’ He said to him, ‘Tend my sheep.’ He said to him the third
time, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me?’ Peter was grieved because he said
to him the third time, ‘Do you love me?’ and he said to him, ‘Lord, you know
everything; you know that I love you.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my sheep.
Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself
and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch
out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you
do not want to go.’ (This he said to show by what kind of death he was
to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, ‘Follow me.’”
John 21:4–19
Not the world’s best marketing pitch, because instead of telling His beloved disciple that
following would lead to personal happiness and easier living, Jesus told Peter he would suffer.
He doubled down on the hard things. If you love Me, you’ll serve. If you love Me, you’ll go where I

Introduction

11

lead you. If you love Me, you’ll lay down your life like I laid down Mine. To which Peter promptly
pointed at John and said, “‘Lord, what about this man?’ Jesus said to him, ‘If it is my will that
he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!’” (vv. 21–22).
That’s the thing about suffering—none of us want it. Peter didn’t want it either, which
begs the question, how did he go from being the guy who denied even knowing Jesus (Matt.
26:69–75; Luke 22:54–62) to being the guy who boldly preached the gospel no matter the
consequences? How was he able to fix his eyes on the hope of heaven in spite of terrible
earthly circumstances? How did he become the pillar of strength and faith he was at the end
of his life?
Because time and again, Peter saw the goodness of the Lord eclipse suffering.

For Bible
Nerds
(like us)
Who Want
to Know
Who (or what) was Jesus referring to
when He asked Peter, “Do you love
me more than these?”
Three options have been suggested
by theologians:
Option #1: “…these [things]?”
Some have argued that Jesus was
referring to nearby fishing paraphernalia (boats, nets, gear) since Peter
had just said, “I am going fishing”
(John 21:3).
But the choice between material
things and the risen Savior seems

ridiculous. So, that probably wasn’t
what Jesus meant.
Option #2: “…these [people]?”
Some have argued that Jesus meant,
“Do you love me more than you love
these other disciples?”
But the choice between loving other
people and loving the risen Lord
Jesus (who the other disciples loved
too) also seems ridiculous. So, that
probably wasn’t what Jesus meant.
Option #3: “…these [people do]?”
We believe Jesus was asking, “Do
you love me more than these other
disciples love me?”
Of course, it wasn’t a competition
over who loved Jesus more. But
Peter had boasted, “I will lay down
my life for you,” right before Jesus
predicted that he would actually
deny Jesus three times:

Simon Peter asked him, “Lord,
where are you going?” Jesus
replied, “Where I am going, you
cannot follow now, but you will follow later.” Peter asked, “Lord, why
can’t I follow you now? I will lay
down my life for you.” Then Jesus
answered, “Will you really lay down
your life for me? Very truly I tell
you, before the rooster crows, you
will disown me three times!” (John
13:36–38 NIV).
In that context, we could probably
expand Jesus’s question to, “Now
that you have denied me three
times, just like I said you would, can
you still brag that you love me more
than any of these other disciples
love me?”
In His mercy (and not unlike a healing exercise), Jesus allowed Peter
to reaffirm his love three times. And
then He confirmed that Peter would
indeed have to lay down his life.

God’s Goodness for the Chosen

Rejoice:
to feel or show great
happiness or delight.

According to Peter’s first New Testament letter, the
hard things we experience in this life are always eclipsed by
the bigger things God is doing in and through them. Which
means instead of lamenting our lack, we should be rejoicing

in it. “Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as
though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you share Christ’s
sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed” (1 Pet. 4:12–13).
Rejoicing in trials is a lot easier said than done. But the way we respond to suffering
will be determined by how well we understand (1) its purpose in our lives, as well as (2) the
blessing it holds, because of (3) how radically good God is.
As “exiles scattered,” such knowledge is particularly important, which brings us to this
Bible study and this reality: followers of Jesus are citizens of heaven, though for now we live
here and—yes—we suffer. But like Peter, we have a calling to share the gospel no matter the
circumstances. To tell others about the hope we have because our eyes are fixed on heaven
and the joy that awaits us there. To make room for God to grow deep roots of strength and
faith in our hearts, because our struggles are being eclipsed again and again and again by the
goodness of the Lord.

And in His goodness, we rejoice.

“Blessed be the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great
mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a
living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable,
undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who
by God’s power are being guarded through faith for a
salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.”
1 Peter 1:3–5

called people to repentance in order to prepare their hearts for the
“Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (Mark 1:4;
John 1:29–30).
Jesus and the life He offers were coming into the world, and
John was the herald of that good news. But, as is sometimes the case,
bad news comes along with the good, because in order for our sins
to be forgiven, we have to first acknowledge them and repent. In

order for us to follow, we have to abandon the things that offend God. In order to experience
the Lord’s abundant provision, we have to accept our own pathetic lack. And in order to be
“born again to a living hope,” we first have to die.

Your Turn
1. Following Jesus requires that we turn away from sin, surrender our future plans, and
trust Him to take care of us—and all that on a daily basis. In what ways do you imagine that
was hard for John the Baptist’s elderly mother? For Jesus’s teenage mother? In what ways are
those things hard for you?

For Bible
Nerds
(like us)
Who Want
to Know
In the Gospel of John, the “Lamb of
God” moniker that John the Baptist
used for Jesus has a rich history from
the Old Testament sacrifice system.
In particular, it references the Jewish
festival called Passover, which is a

remembrance of God’s rescuing of
the Hebrew people out of slavery to
Egypt (called the “Exodus”).
In that event, God commanded
His people to sacrifice a lamb and
smear its blood on their doorframes
so God’s judgment on Egypt would
“pass over” those who demonstrated
their allegiance to God (Ex. 12:1–14).
In obedience to God’s command that
they remember His saving work in
the Exodus, the Jews continued the
annual celebration of Passover with
the sacrifice of a lamb.

John the Baptist understood that
the symbolism of the Exodus and
Passover was coming to its culminating goal, so he identified Jesus
as God’s provision of a “lamb” who
would be sacrificed to save His people from enslavement to sin.
It is no accident that Jesus’s death
occurred during the Passover festival
(see John 18–19). And looking ahead,
Jesus is also often referred to as “the
Lamb” in the book of Revelation (a
book also authored by the apostle
John).

cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but
whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it. For what
does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?’”
Mark 8:34–36
Human beings are hardwired to self-protect. Add to that our twentyfirst-century Western culture, which constantly (and almost exclusively)
glorifies self-focus and self-gratification, and you end up with large swaths
of the population actually opposed to God—because you can’t put God first
and yourself first at the same time. It’s just not possible.
Indeed, we hear “me” messaging on a regular basis. Exhortations to grow
in self-care, self-help, self-worth, self-love. To be proud of being self-made,
self-taught, self-assured, self-determined. To pursue spiritual goals like being
self-affirmed and self-actualized. (Even our phones, which we use for selfeverything, have “I” right in their names!)
In other words, we’re strongly encouraged to be self-obsessed.
But while we’re busy hyper-focusing on ourselves (and feeling wholly

unsatisfied), Jesus offers an alternative: die to yourself—which is quite
a departure from what we’re used to. But those of us who follow Jesus must
reject what the world teaches. We have to surrender control and obey God’s
Word instead. And in so doing, we render ourselves dead to the “all-powerful”
self and alive to Jesus, giving Him free rein to do what He wills in our lives.
That’s what it means to follow. We give up our lives like Jesus gave up
His—and John the Baptist understood the assignment. God tasked him
with preparing the way for the Savior of the world. In fact, it’s appropriate
to think of him as the last of the Old Testament–style prophets assigned to
point others to Jesus. Guys like Isaiah, Micah, and Zechariah.

“And he began to teach
them that the Son of Man
must suffer many things and
be rejected by the elders
and the chief priests and
the scribes and be killed,
and after three days rise
again. And he said this
plainly. And Peter took
him aside and began to
rebuke him. But turning
and seeing his disciples,
he rebuked Peter and said,
‘Get behind me, Satan! For
you are not setting your
mind on the things of God,
but on the things of man.’
And calling the crowd to
him with his disciples, he
said to them, ‘If anyone
would come after me, let
him deny himself and take
up his cross and follow me.
For whoever would save his
life will lose it, but whoever
loses his life for my sake
and the gospel’s will save
it. For what does it profit
a man to gain the whole
world and forfeit his soul?’”
Mark 8:31–36

Once the mission was completed and Jesus came into view,
John was expected to pass from the scene. To himself be eclipsed.
But the Baptizer didn’t cooperate for the sake of obedience
alone. Of course, it’s good and right to obey God, to follow Jesus
no matter the cost, and to trust Him for the outcome—even if
that outcome is death. After all, Jesus died and we must die

too in order to truly live.

But while the bad news of our “death” is necessary, it’s
completely overshadowed by the good news that comes right
after: we die so that we can be born again to a living hope—
which is exactly what the preparer of the way, even in his final
hours from a jail cell, was looking toward.

Your Turn
2. Jesus is calling us to follow all the way to the cross. But far
too often, we carry our “me first” mentality into our relationship
with Him. Meaning, we focus on what He can do for us instead of
what we can do for Him. In what ways are you practicing dying to
yourself, and in what ways are you still putting yourself first?

The fixation on self is the forfeiture of real treasure. In other words, most of us spend so
much time trying to lay up treasure on earth (to feel secure in our bank accounts, be affirmed
by others, be as beautiful, smart, or successful as we perceive those around us to be) that we’ve
lost sight of what’s already ours in Christ.
In his letter, Peter painted a picture of what followers of Christ have been raised to life
for: “a living hope” (1 Pet. 1:3). Incidentally, the Bible doesn’t teach that we should separate
ourselves from all the enjoyment God has provided in the
world. While self-control, self-discipline, and even selfsacrifice are praiseworthy Christian virtues (1 Pet. 4:7–11; 2
Pet. 1:3–11), we aren’t ascetics. On the contrary, God made
the world and everything in it, and He wants us to enjoy

what He made within the bounds He intended.
That said, the reason we’ve been raised to life is to enjoy Him! Along with all the
perks that come from following.

God’s Goodness for the Chosen

If you’re in Christ, you’ve been “born again to a living hope … to an inheritance that is
imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you” (1 Pet. 1:3–4). Which means
the Creator of the world, the One who set the boundaries for the sea (Jer. 5:22) and owns the
cattle on a thousand hills (Ps. 50:10), the author of time and space and galaxies that extend
beyond what our telescopes can see (Isa. 40:26), the King whose heavenly throne is encircled
by an emerald rainbow (Rev. 4:2–3) along with angelic creatures who worship Him day and
night (Rev. 7:11)—

HE has set aside your inheritance.
And there’s more. Not only has God stockpiled awesomeness for you in heaven, He’s also
guarding you on earth. He’s protecting, leading, and providing for you in ways you couldn’t
possibly accomplish on your own, no matter how much me-time you choose to spend. Which
begs the question, what need is there for self-preservation when God is willing to do the work
for you? How could any one of us do a better job of caring for ourselves than the Lord of life
who loves and is love?
Surely His goodness eclipses our “death” and redefines what truly matters in life.
(Spoiler alert, it isn’t you.)

Our New Reality
“And [John’s followers] came to John and said to him, ‘Rabbi [Jesus],
who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore witness—look,
he is baptizing, and all are going to him.’ John answered, ‘A person
cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven. You
yourselves bear me witness, that I said, “I am not the Christ, but I have
been sent before him.” The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The
friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at
the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete.

He must increase, but I must decrease.’”
John 3:26–30

Side note:
Dying to sin might sound
like bad news at first, but
we should remember that
it’s actually the good news
of being rescued from
enslavement to sin! And
rescue from enslavement
should always be viewed as
good news (see Rom. 6).
Obviously.

Bad news does sometimes tag along with the good, and
for us to be alive in Christ we do have to die to sin. Which
means the only hyphenated words we should have on repeat
are the ones we mentioned before, like self-control, selfdiscipline, and self-sacrifice. Or better still, Jesus-focused,
Spirit-controlled, heaven-bound, and hope-filled.
Because we’re not the One we need.
On the contrary, we need Jesus. We need the hope His
resurrection provides, the protection His presence promises,
and the satisfaction our souls find only in Him. Oh that we’d

learn to say along with the herald of the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ:
He must increase. We must decrease.

8. How can you increase your Jesus-focus today?

Seasons 3 and 4 of The Chosen
include psalms from the Old
Testament, which is why each lesson
of this study will close with one.
The book of Psalms is a collection of
songs, hymns, poetry, and prayers.
Some inspire praise, some bring comfort
in grief, but all of them can be spoken
in prayer when words otherwise fail us.

Prayer Focus
Praise Jesus for dying for your sin, so
that you could die to your sin. Praise
Him for rising from the dead, so
that you could rise to new life too.
Thank Him for guarding you in
the here and now, and for the
inheritance He is setting aside
for you in heaven. Ask Him to
increase as you follow, and to
help you decrease.

Sample Prayer

Preserve me, O God, for in you
I take refuge. I say to the LORD, “You
are my Lord; I have no good apart from you.”
As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent
ones, in whom is all my delight. The sorrows of those
who run after another god shall multiply; their drink
offerings of blood I will not pour out or take their names on
my lips. The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold
my lot. The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed,
I have a beautiful inheritance. I bless the LORD who gives me
counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me. I have set the
LORD always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall
not be shaken. Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole
being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure. For you will
not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see
corruption. You make known to me the path of life;
in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your
right hand are pleasures forevermore.

windows are draped in dark cloth, the only light coming from

ANDREW: Rabbi? (Jesus turns, sees Andrew in the
doorway, looking shabby, his shirt torn at the collar. Andrew
holds a cup of water and a small plate of food.)
ANDREW (CONT’D) (bending down to set the provisions

JESUS: Pretty? (He takes a sip to wash it down and both men laugh.) Tastes like Elijah’s

ANDREW: Can we be laughing?
JESUS: Why not? You know, some of the moments in which we laugh the hardest
come around the time of a funeral. Our hearts are so tender, all our emotions are
right at the surface; laughter and tears closer than ever. And
believe me—I sat many a shiva with John when we were kids
and he could not hold a sullen mood for seven straight days.
Never happened.
ANDREW: I feel guilty. I should be in shambles.

Shiva:
a period of seven days of
formal mourning for the
dead, beginning immediately
after the funeral; a ritual
referred to as “sitting shiva.”

JESUS: No. No, Andrew, there is no should in grief. There’s
no right way to mourn. You already experienced much grief when John was arrested.
Falling to pieces again would not honor John’s memory any more than feeling nothing

Precious Faith
Peter said we’d be “grieved by various trials.” That’s a pretty
wide net, but it’s accurate because humanity’s problems run the
gamut. From not having enough money to being responsible for
an abundance. From being burdened by the pain of a loved one

Run the gamut:
a saying that means to
experience or display
the complete range
of something.

to feeling loved by no one. From experiencing the consequences
of our own sin to becoming the victim of someone else’s. From being deficient physically,
mentally, or emotionally to our abilities going unnoticed, unutilized, or unappreciated. From
unexpected tragedy to the chronic illnesses that seem to steal our years away.
There are just so many reasons to grieve. Yet, somehow, trials purify our faith.

For Bible
Nerds
(like us)
Who Want
to Know
It’s easy for us in the twenty-first century to assume belief was easier for
the first-century followers of Jesus.
They could see Him, hear Him, literally touch Him. It sometimes feels
like we’re more limited in our access
to the evidence of Jesus being real.

Peter wrote with an awareness of the
benefit he had in being an eyewitness to Jesus on earth. In his second
letter to the churches in Asia Minor,
he referred to his experience with
James and John on the Mount of
Transfiguration and said:
“For we did not follow cleverly
devised myths when we made known
to you the power and coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For when
he received honor and glory from
God the Father, and the voice was
borne to him by the Majestic Glory,
‘This is my beloved Son, with whom

I am well pleased,’ we ourselves
heard this very voice borne from
heaven, for we were with him on the
holy mountain” (2 Pet. 1:16–18; see
also Matt. 17:1–8; Mark 9:2–8; Luke
9:28–36).
And so, Peter congratulates his
readers for believing without the
advantages of physically meeting
Jesus.
“Though you have not seen him,
you love him. Though you do not
now see him, you believe in him and
rejoice with joy that is inexpressible
and filled with glory” (1 Pet. 1:8–9).

32

God’s Goodness for the Chosen

According to Peter, faith in Jesus means we believe Him for what we don’t yet see. It
means we continually surrender, even when our circumstances are far from ideal. It means
we trust Him to provide, even when our bank accounts come up short. It means we remain
confident that God’s words are true, even when the world says they’re not. It means we stand
firm knowing He won’t fail us. Or leave us. Or forget us.
That kind of radical faith is purified by trials the way gold is purified by fire, which is an
appropriate metaphor since the world is going to hell in a handbasket. Seems in order to go
the distance with Jesus, we’re going to need the kind of faith that does too.

“Dear friends, do not be surprised
at the fiery ordeal that has come on
you to test you, as though something
strange were happening to you. But
rejoice inasmuch as you participate
in the sufferings of Christ.”
1 Peter 4:12–13 (NIV)

Your Turn
1. We don’t often think of Jesus being “grieved
by various trials,” but He was. What kinds of trials do
you imagine He grieved? What trials in your life are you
grieving?

Trial by Fire
“I will … refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is
tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will
say, ‘They are my people’; and they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’”
Zechariah 13:9

PRAISE

Gold is found in ore and is either mined from the ground
or collected from alluvial deposits in riverbeds. At first, it’s
barely discernable among all its impurities. Sand and dirt have
to be washed away, and then whatever’s left has to be placed
into fire. When gold reaches its melting point (1,947° F), it
liquifies, separating the pure gold from the impure metals and
contaminants it was once inextricably linked to.

33

Ore:
natural rock or sediment
typically containing metals
that can be mined, treated,
and sold at a profit.

Alluvial deposits:
loose clay, silt, sand, or
gravel that has been carried
and placed by running water.

That’s the process for gold. It’s also the process for us.
Because in order for our faith to be separated from impurities
it’s otherwise linked to, we must go through the Refiner’s fire.
So, what contaminates our faith? What impurities must
be purged? No doubt there are lots of things we could point to,
but they can be summarized in one word: unbelief. We don’t
wholly believe what the Bible says about life and death, right

“Behold, I have refined
you, but not as silver;
I have tried you in the
furnace of affliction.”
Isaiah 48:10

“The crucible is for silver,
and the furnace is for gold,
and the LORD tests hearts.”
Proverbs 17:3

and wrong, truth and goodness, happiness and wholeness, sin
and salvation, or what actually matters unto eternity.
In other words, the thing that must be removed from our
faith is our lack of faith. Like the process of purifying gold,
our sin is washed away (thank You, Jesus) and whatever’s left is
placed into the proverbial fire. Which means sometimes God
allows our circumstances to be far from ideal so that we won’t
trust in them. He allows our bank accounts to come up short

“But who can endure the
day of his coming, and
who can stand when he
appears? For he is like a
refiner’s fire … He will sit
as a refiner and purifier of
silver, and he will purify the
sons of Levi and refine them
like gold and silver, and
they will bring offerings in
righteousness to the LORD.”
Malachi 3:2–3

so that we’ll look to Him for provision instead. He allows
us to be challenged so that when His words prove true, our
confidence in Him grows.
We are grieved by various trials so that our faith—more
precious than gold—will lead us to hope. And then to praise.

“For to set the mind on
the flesh is death, but
to set the mind on the
Spirit is life and peace.”
Romans 8:6

“Thus says the LORD: Do
justice and righteousness,
and deliver from the hand
of the oppressor him who
has been robbed. And do
no wrong or violence to the
resident alien, the fatherless,
and the widow, nor shed
innocent blood in this place.”
Jeremiah 22:3

“These are the things that
you shall do: Speak the
truth to one another; render
in your gates judgments
that are true and make for

rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Not
only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings,
knowing that suffering produces endurance,
and endurance produces character, and
character produces hope, and hope does
not put us to shame, because God’s love
has been poured into our hearts through
the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”
Romans 5:1–5
Suffering exposes the things we instinctively hope in,
like financial security, physical comfort, other people, our
own strength, plans, health, and accomplishments. When
any of those things are threatened—and we realize how
fragile and futile they actually are—we tend to panic.
But we also tend to pray.
Sometimes we turn to God in anger. Sometimes we
turn to Him in tears. Sometimes we turn to God in pure
desperation. In any case, we ask hard questions like Why
would You? How could You? Because suffering seems to
automatically bring with it a lot of confusion, hurt, fear,
second-guessing, and even judgment of God’s character and
the things He allows.
But the truth is that God sees beyond the moment
we’re living in. He knows all the ways our faith is deficient,
and how unbelief endangers our ability to keep following.
He knows the character qualities we need more of, and He
knows exactly when we’re going to need them. He knows

“For we ourselves were once
foolish, disobedient, led astray,
slaves to various passions and
pleasures, passing our days
in malice and envy, hated by
others and hating one another.
But when the goodness and
loving kindness of God our
Savior appeared, he saved us,
not because of works done
by us in righteousness, but
according to his own mercy, by
the washing of regeneration
and renewal of the Holy Spirit,
whom he poured out on us
richly through Jesus Christ
our Savior, so that being
justified by his grace we might
become heirs according to
the hope of eternal life.”
Titus 3:3–7

“But whatever gain I had, I
counted as loss for the sake
of Christ. Indeed, I count
everything as loss because
of the surpassing worth of
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
For his sake I have suffered
the loss of all things and count
them as rubbish, in order
that I may gain Christ and be
found in him, not having a
righteousness of my own that
comes from the law, but that
which comes through faith
in Christ, the righteousness
from God that depends
on faith— that I may know
him and the power of his
resurrection, and may share
his sufferings, becoming like
him in his death, that by any
means possible I may attain the

suffering is allowed so that endurance will increase. Because
endurance produces character. And character produces hope.

Jesus conquered the grave and ascended to the place He’s now

these things culminate in the “praise and glory and honor” of our Lord Jesus (1 Pet. 1:7). They
just do. Or at least they will eventually, because we can’t help it. We’re hardwired to praise the
Savior, to defy our circumstances with “joy that is inexpressible and

filled with glory,” because we know that the One who has allowed hard things loves
us beyond comprehension.
When we begin to grasp the enormity of His love, we become more willing to accept our
trials and grief because we trust Him.
We trust Him.

As Simon Peter said, we’re grieved by many trials. But, in spite of them, Peter stood firm
because he knew exactly who Jesus was—who He truly is—and he praised Him:

That kind of radical faith—once tested and purified and made more precious than
gold—will indeed keep us defiantly praising all the way to heaven.

JESUS: Should we avoid dark places out of fear, or should
we be light to them, like Simon and Judas were on their

Do you think he would be so appalled by what happens in
that temple over there that he couldn’t stand to be in this

In ancient Israel, Caesarea
at Philippi was the religious
center for Baal worship,
and it eventually led to the
worship of many false gods,
including Greek gods. For
generations, the region
was dominated by pagan
practices and unspeakable
acts of sexual immorality.
The city itself was located
at the base of a cliff where
spring water flowed. The
water ran directly out of the
mouth of a cave and into the
deep waters below. Since
the people believed that
caves were gateways to the
underworld, this particular
one came to be known
as “The Gates of Hell.”

Unanswered Questions
Life is full of unanswered questions, even for faithful followers of Jesus. Indeed, going
where Jesus goes and doing what He commands doesn’t automatically grant us knowledge—
which seems obvious when you think about it. After all, following isn’t leading (duh), which
means we often don’t get to know where we’re going or why things are happening.
We don’t have the map.
We didn’t write the playbook.
And there’s nothing new under the sun because the prophets of the Old Testament had
questions too, mostly about how the Lord would bring salvation. They longed for change.
They wanted relief from their circumstances. They wanted to move from the era of promise
to the era of fulfillment (1 Pet. 1:10–12).
But the job of the prophets was to herald the promise of salvation, which would eventually
come through the life, suffering, and resurrection of Jesus. They had a role to play in God’s

greater plan, and they were required to live it out in spite of their unanswered

questions.

Incidentally, so are you.

Your Turn
1. God chose David to be king over Israel and
called him “a man after my heart.” Yet there’s no one in
the entire Bible who asked more questions of God than
David did—which means there’s nothing wrong with
asking! What are some of your unanswered questions?

For Bible Nerds
(like us)
Who Want
to Know
In broad terms, the time of the OT
Scriptures is thought of as the era
of promise, and the time of the NT
is thought of as the beginning of the
era of fulfillment. This is illustrated
in some of Jesus’s own statements
recorded in the NT.
For example, after His resurrection,
Jesus told His followers, “These are
my words that I spoke to you while
I was still with you, that everything
written about me in the Law of Moses
and the Prophets and the Psalms
must be fulfilled … Thus it is written,

“And when [God] had removed [Saul],
he raised up David to be their king, of
whom he testified and said, ‘I have found
in David the son of Jesse a man after
my heart, who will do all my will.’ Of
this man’s offspring God has brought to
Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised.”
Acts 13:22–23

that the Christ should suffer and on
the third day rise from the dead, and
that repentance for the forgiveness
of sins should be proclaimed in his
name to all nations, beginning from
Jerusalem” (Luke 24:44–47).
The apostle Paul reflected the same
thing, writing, “For I delivered to
you as of first importance what I also
received: that Christ died for our sins
in accordance with the Scriptures,
that he was buried, that he was raised
on the third day in accordance with
the Scriptures” (1 Cor. 15:3–4).
In short, what was promised in the OT
has begun to be fulfilled in the NT.
Peter’s comment about the prophets of old who longed to know more
about the coming of Christ (1 Pet.
1:10–12) is reminiscent of when one of

them said: “When I, Daniel, had seen
the vision, I sought to understand it”
(Dan. 8:15). But Peter’s words sound
even more like something Jesus said:
“For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to
see what you see, and did not see it,
and to hear what you hear, and did not
hear it” (Matt. 13:17; Luke 10:24).
Thus the NT shows the beginning of
the fulfillment of the OT promises.
But Peter goes on to say something
about the second coming of Jesus (1
Pet. 1:13), which we are still awaiting—a promise yet to be fulfilled (see
some of Jesus’s words on this in John
14:1–3). And we have an assigned
mission from Jesus while we wait for
His second coming (Matt. 28:18–20;
Acts 1:6–8), which is why we describe
the NT era as the beginning of the
fulfillment with more yet to come!

Who Want
to Know
David, the youngest son of Jesse from
the town of Bethlehem, was a musically
talented shepherd boy who served
ancient Israel’s first king, Saul (1 Sam.
16–17). When Saul became disobedient to God, the Lord announced he
would be replaced with “a man after
[God’s] own heart,” which turned out
to be David (1 Sam. 13:13–14; Acts
13:22). Ultimately, David reigned as
king for forty years (ca. 1010–970
BC), and he’s remembered as the
most beloved king in Israel’s history.
Indeed, the Messiah is called “the
Son of David” with reference to God’s
promise to put a descendant of David
on the eternal throne of God’s people
(2 Sam. 7:12–16).
David’s transition into kingship was
fraught with difficulties, the first of
which being that Saul was murderously reluctant to turn over the throne
(1 Sam. 18–31; 2 Sam. 1–6). David’s
kingship had its own problems as
well (2 Sam. 11–24). Some of David’s
reflections on those hardships show
up in his many songs that are now
part of ancient Israel’s hymnbook, the
book of Psalms. Among the several
different genres of psalms (thanksgiving, wisdom, royal, etc.), the largest is
laments.
In lament psalms, the psalmist expresses
his unhappy emotions (sadness, fear,
anger, confusion, worry, etc.) and calls
upon God to intervene. Toward their
closing, most lament psalms turn in
hope to expressing confidence in God
and/or praising Him.

“‘For my thoughts are not your
thoughts, neither are my ways your
ways,’ declares the LORD. ‘As the
heavens are higher than the earth, so
are my ways higher than your ways and
my thoughts than your thoughts.’”
Isaiah 55:8–9 (NIV)
We have a lot of opinions about how life should and
shouldn’t go. When our circumstances deviate, we can
easily become disillusioned with God. And not only do we
have questions regarding why things went wrong, we have
a lot of emotion attached to those questions.
For example, when trials persist, we can easily feel
neglected by God. When we experience strife or loss, we
might wonder if He truly cares about our pain. When we’re
burdened and bogged down, we may question if He’ll ever
relent. When answers don’t come quickly, we may think
He’s abandoned us altogether.
At different times in his life David felt those things
too, and in his psalms of lament he didn’t pretend to
understand. On the contrary, he spoke gut-wrenchingly
honest prayers in which he asked God the hard questions.
My soul is greatly troubled.
But you, O LORD —how long?
Psalm 6:3

RESOLVE

47

Why, O LORD, do you stand far away?
Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
Psalm 10:1
How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever?
How long will you hide your face from me?
How long must I take counsel in my soul
and have sorrow in my heart all day?
How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
Psalm 13:1–2
For you are the God in whom I take refuge; why have you rejected me?
Psalm 43:2
There’s plenty more where that came from, and we have a lot to learn from the way David
prayed. We could start with the fact that God doesn’t need our prayers to be “pretty.” He
doesn’t expect us to be well-spoken, or unemotional, or unwavering in our faith because He
knows exactly what we’re thinking and feeling already (Ps. 139:1–2). He grieves when we
grieve (Ps. 34:18). He keeps track of our tears (Ps. 56:8). And He wants us to pour our hearts
out to Him in prayer, like David did (Ps. 55:22), and to trust Him with our doubts and
worries and wonderings (Phil. 4:6–7).
But that doesn’t mean we’re entitled to the answers.
Read that again.
We’re not entitled to answers.
And David knew it, which is probably why he refused to stay stuck in lament. Instead, he
intentionally shifted his focus from his own suffering to God’s character, reminding himself
again and again of God’s goodness, patience, wisdom, love, and power to save. Because

waiting for answers doesn’t change who God fundamentally is.

Praiseworthy. No matter our feelings, God deserves our attention, devotion, and
worship. But far too often we think of ourselves instead—what others have that we don’t, what
we need and “deserve,” how we’re going to achieve our worldly goals, how we might attain
a greater degree of satisfaction. Meanwhile, the only One who actually deserves anything is
waiting patiently for us to turn our attention away from ourselves and toward Him.

Right Words
“Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For
we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but
the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings
too deep for words. And he who searches hearts
knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the
Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the
will of God. And we know that for those who
love God all things work together for good, for
those who are called according to his purpose.”
Romans 8:26–28
Truth is, our lack of understanding and wisdom can cause
us to ask the wrong questions. But even then, God works on
our behalf. According to the New Testament book of Romans,
the Holy Spirit—third person of the Trinity—knows exactly
what to say and He intercedes for us. Which means,
He’s filling the space between us and the unknown. He’s using
His knowledge of God’s will and our own hearts to intervene
on our behalf. He’s focused on glorifying Jesus and making us
like Him (John 14:26), while He keeps our name and unique
circumstances ever before the throne of God.
Such knowledge should increase our resolve to trust, even
when our questions go unanswered. Like the prophets who
came before us—those who stood fast and remained faithful for
their sake and ours—we can resolve to believe God will bring
about His perfect plan in His perfect time.

Trinity = the state of being three.
“God is a Trinity, Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit, each an uncreated
person, one in essence, equal in

Common analogies include an
egg, which has three distinct
parts (shell, white, yolk) but
remains one egg, or an apple,
which has three distinct parts
(skin, flesh, core) but remains
one apple.
Of course, all analogies eventually break down, and God is not
an egg or an apple. Duh.
Each member of the Trinity is
not a “part” of God; each is fully
God. So while we can define the

Ignorance Isn’t Bliss
When it comes to following Jesus and the trials therein, we can easily find ourselves in
a whirlwind of confusion. And confusion isn’t merely a lack of information, or the conflict
between expectations and reality; confusion actually has the potential to turn into profound
disappointment. It knocks us off balance. It makes us feel stuck. It steals our joy. It weakens
our confidence.
It threatens our faith.
Confusion can, in fact, be paralyzing, because when the ground beneath our feet shifts, our
instinct is to self-protect. To hunker down. To retreat from God and sometimes other people.
Which means confusion can cause us to lose some of our gospel-sharing boldness and brightness,
because when we feel uncertain, it’s a lot harder to encourage and spur on the people around us.
But as we discussed in the previous lesson, we’re a part of a bigger thing God is doing.
And just like the believers who came before us, we can resolve to remain. We can fix our eyes

For Bible
Nerds
(like us)
Who Want
to Know
For the early disciples, confusion
came with the job, especially when
Jesus spoke of His imminent departure and the suffering He would
endure at the hands of Jewish
authorities. He said:
1. “The Son of Man must suffer many
things and be rejected by the elders
and chief priests and scribes, and be
killed, and on the third day be raised”
(Luke 9:22; see also Matt. 16:21–23;
Mark 8:31–33).

2. “Let these words sink into your
ears: The Son of Man is about to be
delivered into the hands of men”
(Luke 9:44; see also Matt. 17:22–23;
Mark 9:30–32).
3. “See, we are going up to
Jerusalem, and everything that is
written about the Son of Man by
the prophets will be accomplished.
For he will be delivered over to the
Gentiles and will be mocked and
shamefully treated and spit upon.
And after flogging him, they will
kill him, and on the third day he will
rise” (Luke 18:31–33; see also Matt.
20:17–19; Mark 10:32–34).
Reading these things today, it all
makes sense; we know the whole
story. But for first-century followers—especially those looking to be
saved from Rome—Jesus’s words

didn’t sound like predictions of success. The Israelites wanted to be
delivered from their oppressors, not
delivered over to them. And even
when Jesus promised that after suffering He would “on the third day be
raised”—what did that even mean?
No one had ever done anything like
it before.
It was too much for the disciples to
grasp, and twice in his gospel, Luke
explained their confusion: “But they
did not understand this saying, and
it was concealed from them, so that
they might not perceive it. And they
were afraid to ask him about this
saying” (Luke 9:45) and “But they
understood none of these things.
This saying was hidden from them,
and they did not grasp what was
said” (Luke 18:34).

Thorns and Such
“So to keep me from becoming conceited … a thorn was given me
in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from
becoming conceited. Three times I pleaded with the Lord about
this, that it should leave me. But he said to me, ‘My grace is

sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect
in weakness.’ Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my
weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the
sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships,
persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.”
2 Corinthians 12:7–10

GRACE

61

Throughout his ministry, Paul (author of 2 Corinthians, along with a dozen other
books in the New Testament) struggled with something so difficult, he referred to it as
“a messenger of Satan.” Perhaps he was referring to an actual demon. Perhaps a physical
ailment. Perhaps a thought, emotion, or memory he just couldn’t shake. Perhaps a
combination of all of the above.
There’s been endless speculation regarding Paul’s thorn. But knowing the precise details
doesn’t really matter. What matters is that Paul responded to his confusion and frustration
by leaning into God’s grace.
Sometimes we think “grace” means God will grant us whatever we long for. But clearly
in Paul’s case, it meant the opposite. In fact, the hardship he faced was the catalyst for God’s
grace in his life, as well as the conduit through which it continually flowed—from God to
Paul, and then from Paul to other people.
On the surface, it seems strange that God’s power is
made perfect in weakness. In hardships. In suffering. In
confusion. But when you really think about it, it makes
sense because all those things help get us out of

“My grace is all you need” =

own needs, let alone those of others. And our neediness forces us to look to the One who

Who Want
to Know
The significant Christian leader known
primarily by his Roman name Paul (formerly known by his Jewish name, Saul)
was a first-century Jew and a Roman
citizen from Tarsus, the capital of the
Roman province of Cilicia (a region in

modern Turkey). He was a Pharisee
trained in Jerusalem by Gamaliel (Acts
22:3; 23:6; 26:4–5; Phil. 3:5), and he
was passionately against Christianity,
so much so that he was in favor of
hunting down and punishing followers
of Jesus (Acts 8:3; 9:1–3; 22:4–5; Gal.
1:13–14; Phil. 3:6).
But that all changed when he met
the risen Jesus Christ on the road
to Damascus (Acts 9:1–22; cf. Acts
22:1–21; 26:1–32). The former opponent of the Christian faith became
a passionate representative of the
gospel, traveling around the ancient

world preaching the risen Jesus and
establishing churches (Acts 13–21).
He authored thirteen letters that
have been preserved as Scripture
among the other New Testament
documents.
The former persecutor of Christians
ended up being persecuted himself
for his faith in Christ (Acts 21–28),
and while the New Testament does
not record when and how Paul died,
early church traditions report that
he was beheaded in Rome at the
command of Emperor Nero (ca. AD
64–68).

GRACE

God is gracious and full of grace. It’s fundamental to who He is, which means His
grace toward us doesn’t ebb and flow. It’s not available sporadically or conditionally. On the
contrary, God is love (1 John 4:8) and extends grace constantly,
even when we don’t recognize it. Whether through Christ’s
death, resurrection, and the resulting free gift of salvation; or
through the conviction of sin in order to get our attention;
or through the ongoing empowering of the saints to live

and act according to their calling. God is always and forever
extending grace in spite of any confusion or doubt you may
struggle with.
More than that, He’s making “all grace abound to you.”
Think about that: God is sparing you no good

thing. He may not alleviate your suffering when you want
Him to. For reasons known only to Him who is all-wise and
all-knowing, He may not answer your questions or remove
your confusion right away. But He’s providing every good
thing you need, in every moment of need, so that you’ll

heavenly kingdom until Christ returns (Matt. 16:18–19; 24:42–44). And it allows you to
experience confusion without being derailed by it, because God’s grace and kindness toward
you is a banner of love over everything else (Eph. 3:17–19).
Indeed, God’s glorious grace eclipses our temporary confusion. It’s not even a fair fight.

“For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the

flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.”

Peter warned us to not be “conformed to the passions of [our] former ignorance, but as
he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, ‘You shall
be holy, for I am holy’” (1 Pet. 1:14–16).
Um, what now? It’s one thing to set our minds on God’s grace and on our confident
expectation that Jesus will return and bring our confusion and suffering to an end. But to be
perfect as God is perfect? That’s an impossibly high, perhaps even confusing, standard.
(See what we did there?)
But Peter wasn’t saying that we’d be able to attain perfection on
earth (and Simon Peter’s life as recorded in the New Testament is
evidence of that!). He was exhorting us to focus on God’s grace to us
in Jesus, the only One who has ever lived perfectly holy (1 Pet. 2:22;
1 John 3:5). And by that grace, (a) we have Jesus’s righteousness
applied to us and (b) we are given the Holy Spirit, who is transforming
us, which (c) will reach its pinnacle at the second coming of Jesus.
So, for now, we set our minds on the things of the Spirit. In so
doing, we prepare ourselves for action and remain sober-minded
because our eyes are fixed on the grace that will surely be poured
out and brought to completion when Jesus Christ comes again.
And our confusion becomes much smaller in the shadow of

time. Things like beauty, adoration, respect, reputation,
accomplishment, and of course, money. But the truth is, even
gold and silver will perish because the things of this world are not going with us into heaven.
Of course, eternity is difficult to wrap our brains around. After all, we live in the here
and now. We have people in our lives who we love and are responsible for. We have bills to pay
and obligations to meet. We have ideas and goals, and some of us will have the better part of
a century to try reaching them. And all that means we can’t—and shouldn’t—simply check
out, no matter how heavenly minded we become.
Nevertheless, Peter reminded his readers that we don’t

actually belong here. That we’re exiles because the

moment any one of us chooses to follow Jesus, we become
citizens of heaven. This world is no longer our home, so it’s
actually nonsensical to store up treasure and to strive for what

we know won’t last.
Think about it. If you were visiting a foreign country and
were told customs wasn’t going to let you bring anything back,
would you spend your time buying souvenirs? Of course not,
because there would be far better ways to spend your time and
treasure.
The same is true for us. And since the Father judges
“according to each one’s deeds,” it’s in our best interest to
invest in what actually matters to Him.

“[Jesus] came and preached

to a literal headpiece; rather, he’s
talking about the honor due to faith-

has stood the test he will receive the

Paul also used the athletic term to
describe people as his “crown” when
Jesus comes again: “Therefore, my
brothers, whom I love and long for, my
joy and crown, stand firm thus in the
Lord, my beloved” (Phil. 4:1); and, “For
what is our hope or joy or crown of
boasting before our Lord Jesus at his
coming? Is it not you?” (1 Thess. 2:19).

The term was used yet again by John
to address the subject of life in eternity: “Be faithful unto death, and
I will give you the crown of life. He
who has an ear, let him hear what the
Spirit says to the churches. The one
who conquers will not be hurt by the
second death” (Rev. 2:10–11).

Likewise, James 1:12 used the athletic crown term to reference eternal
life for those who persevere in faith:

Specifically, our motives and actions and what we did or didn’t do for the Lord in the time
we were given.
Such knowledge should change what we’re choosing, right? It should compel us to do
more for the kingdom of God; to be more engaged in His agenda and far less focused on
our own; to open our eyes to the needs of others while no longer trying to please them; to
become singularly focused on pleasing the One who deserves our praise and who we’ll soon
see face-to-face—and then be judged by.
(Cue very deep breath.)
Thing is, God knows we humans are motivated by being rewarded, and He uses that
desire to keep us focused on investing in His kingdom and His priorities. To that end, we
should wholeheartedly embrace our status as exiles and live like our Father in heaven, who
has promised us abundance, beauty, security, and riches beyond our comprehension: “What
no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for
those who love him” (Isa. 64:4; 1 Cor. 2:9).

Proper Fear
“The fear of the LORD leads to life, and whoever has it

Proverbs 19:23
God has proven His love for us, that’s for sure (Rom. 5:8), and the Bible tells us to rest in
His love (Matt. 11:28–30), because we’re saved by grace and not by our works (Eph. 2:8–9).
The work of salvation has been accomplished (Col. 2:9–15), God keeps watch over our
coming and going (Ps. 121:5–8), and He has promised to faithfully meet our needs (Phil.
4:19). Our eternal home is forever secure (John 5:24; 14:2–3), and God is storing up treasure
for us there, “where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and
steal” (Matt. 6:19–21).
But God’s generosity, kindness, and favor toward us doesn’t mean He approves of or
even tolerates all our choices. On the contrary, He is in the process of conforming us to
the image of His Son (Rom. 8:28–30). As children of God, we’re expected to surrender to
and obey Him while we’re waiting for eternity to commence. When it does, the same One
who saved us and cares for us now will judge us (Acts 10:34–43). The One who, as Peter
described, “was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the
last times” (1 Pet. 1:20).
And that should send a proper chill down our spines. God will judge our works, so
we should live with a healthy amount of fear. Not dread or terror or panic, but a solemn

understanding that God is watching, that He has promised to discipline us the way a good
parent should (Heb. 12:4–11), and that He will hold us accountable for our choices.
So, when Jesus taught His followers to forgive without limits (Matt. 18:21–35) and love
even our enemies (5:43–45), when He said things like “if anyone slaps you on the right cheek,
turn to him the other also” (v. 39) and “if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two
miles” (v. 41), He was giving us a picture of who God is. He was helping us understand how God
responds. He was explaining how we as God’s children are supposed to respond. To choose
humility over pride, generosity over materialism, kindness and patience and graciousness over
selfishness. To behave in a way that allows people around us to see Jesus in us.
Those of us who believe Him will choose His values over worldly things because (a)
our reward in heaven will be great but also because (b) our life on earth will be

blessed.

who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for

for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful,

revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you
falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in
heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.’”
Matthew 5:2–12
Blessed is both a familiar and unfamiliar word. Christians tend
to use it in place of the word lucky, lest anyone think that we think
good things happen by chance. We also “bless this food to our bodies”
before eating, mind our manners with a “bless you” after someone

And the whole point is that God’s favor is better than temporal happiness, contrary
to the “pursue your own happiness no matter the cost” culture we live in. Happiness, by
definition, is conditional, which means it’s dependent on momentary circumstances—our
happenings—and is therefore fleeting. But the blessings Jesus spoke of point to a fuller, more
significant kind of human flourishing. Not in the material sense like those who seem to have
it all, but in the faith-affirming, peace-abiding, future-securing sense our souls truly long for.
Once we belong to Him, we’re ushered into that new reality where momentary suffering
is eclipsed by God’s immediate favor, His permanent presence, and the imperishable riches
He’s setting aside in heaven for those who choose to remain steadfast and continually invest
in His kingdom.

those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their
riches? Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price of
his life, for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice, that he
should live on forever and never see the pit. For he sees that even the
wise die; the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth
to others. Their graves are their homes forever, their dwelling places to
all generations, though they called lands by their own names. Man in his
pomp will not remain; he is like the beasts that perish. This is the path
of those who have foolish confidence; yet after them people approve
of their boasts. Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; death
shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in
the morning. Their form shall be consumed in Sheol, with
no place to dwell. But God will ransom my soul from
the power of Sheol, for he will receive me.

Heart of the Matter
For most of us, following Jesus isn’t always what it’s cracked up to be. Sounds irreverent,
but it’s true because even when we’re not trying to, we have preconceived notions about what
God should do, where He should lead, and how He should intervene in our lives—including
all the ways we think He should prevent our suffering.
The same thing was true for the disciples. Not only did Jesus require them to do
surprisingly hard things, but the opposition to what they were doing continued to grow—all
the way up to the moment when Jesus and (presumably) His followers were run outta town
by a murderous mob (John 10:22–42). And then to top it off, they received word that their
good friend Lazarus was dead (John 11:1–16).

For Bible
Nerds
(like us)
Who Want
to Know
The Gospel of John tells us more
about the apostle Thomas than any
other New Testament writer does.
John regularly referred to him as “the
Twin” (which is the Greek equivalent
of the Hebrew and/or Aramaic name,
“Thomas”).
Nevertheless, instead of “the Twin,”
people today usually dub him as
“Doubting Thomas” due to his
refusal to believe in the resurrection of Jesus until he had substantial
proof. Meaning, he wanted to see
Jesus in the flesh with his own eyes:
“So the other disciples told [Thomas],
‘We have seen the Lord.’ But he said
to them, ‘Unless I see in his hands the

mark of the nails, and place my finger
into the mark of the nails, and place
my hand into his side, I will never
believe.’
Eight days later, his disciples were
inside again, and Thomas was with
them. Although the doors were
locked, Jesus came and stood among
them and said, ‘Peace be with you.’
Then he said to Thomas, ‘Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put
out your hand, and place it in my side.
Do not disbelieve, but believe.’
Thomas answered him, ‘My Lord and
my God!’ Jesus said to him, ‘Have
you believed because you have seen
me? Blessed are those who have not
seen and yet have believed’” (John
20:25–29).
But the incident in John 11 shows a
different side of Thomas. When Jesus
told the group they were going to the
already dead Lazarus, back in the dangerous Judean region from which they
had just fled for their lives(!), Thomas

spoke up: “Let us also go, that we
may die with him” (John 11:16).
What can be credited as raw courage, was also tainted by pessimism
because while Thomas was willing
to choose death with Jesus (and
Lazarus), his statement suggested
that he wasn’t reassured by Jesus’s
own words (see vv. 9–10). And he certainly wasn’t yet understanding that
Jesus alone would sacrificially die for
him and everyone else.
Sometime after, Thomas asked the
clarifying question about the way
of salvation (14:5), to which Jesus
responded, “I am the way, and the
truth, and the life. No one comes
to the Father except through me”
(14:6).
So, we can be grateful for Thomas’s
example of courage in his willingness
to follow Jesus unto death, but also
in his willingness to honestly express
doubt and ask hard questions. As a
result, his faith was strengthened, as
is ours.

LOVE

87

It wasn’t how they assumed people would respond to the Messiah, or the reward they
expected to receive for following Him, or the way they hoped Jesus would care for one of His
closest friends. After all, He had healed so many others. But upon hearing Lazarus was near
death, “he stayed two days longer in the place where he was” (John 11:6).
Truth be told, little of what the disciples experienced lined up with their preconceived
notions. Not only were their circumstances brutal, so was the fact that Jesus didn’t prevent or
respond or intervene in ways that would’ve spared them much heartache.
And now we’ve arrived at the heart of the matter.

Your Turn
1. In spite of following Jesus, the twelve apostles still faced loss and heartbreak. And like
them, sometimes our circumstances profoundly disappoint us regarding the ways Jesus is
working (or seemingly not working) in our lives.
What are some of your preconceived notions about Jesus and what following Him should
be like? What are some of your profound disappointments?

sweep them away as with a

it fades and withers.”

“As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes
like a flower of the field; for the wind passes over
it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more.”
Psalm 103:15–16
As much as we like to think of ourselves as strong, capable,
and important, according to Scripture, humanity is actually
frail, desperate, and easily forgotten. We’re like flowers that
fall, grass that withers, mist that vanishes. We are dust, and
“to dust [we] shall return” (Gen. 3:19). Which means any and
all human achievement is temporary and, as Peter said, cannot
accomplish what the eternal word of God can accomplish.
What it has accomplished and will accomplish.

“What is your life? For
you are a mist that
appears for a little time
and then vanishes.”
James 4:14

But that doesn’t stop us from trying. Oh, how we try.
We strive and strain and reach and run toward the things we
want … but also away from suffering. Indeed, we usually see
suffering as being the opposite of good. We try to avoid difficult

“And I heard a loud voice

circumstances, and we fear pain, all the while knowing it’s
impossible to go through life without eventually experiencing
all of it.
Lest we despair over our fleeting earthly existence and
the weakness and heartache therein, Peter (an experienced
sufferer) reminds us that God has intervened already, and that
through Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection we are born again,
“not of perishable seed but of imperishable” (1 Pet. 1:23). In
other words, God has made us spiritually new and promised
us an eternal home, one where (a) our names will not only be

But we’re not there yet. So, in the meantime, we hold fast to hope and soldier on, with
new hearts that are being filled with all the fullness of God.

2. In what way(s) have you experienced your own weakness and frailty?

3. If life is fleeting, so is any pain and heartbreak that
comes your way. How does that change the way you view
suffering?

be clothed thus in white
garments, and I will never

effective; it abides.

4. What does it mean that God’s word “abides”? In what
ways are you encouraged to know that “you have been born
again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through
the living and abiding word of God” (1 Pet. 1:23)?

“Beloved, let us love one
another, for love is from
God, and whoever loves
has been born of God and
knows God. Anyone who
does not love does not
know God, because God is
love. In this the love of God
was made manifest among
us, that God sent his only
Son into the world, so that
we might live through him.
In this is love, not that we
have loved God but that he
loved us and sent his Son
to be the propitiation for
our sins. Beloved, if God
so loved us, we also ought
to love one another. No
one has ever seen God;
if we love one another,
God abides in us and his
love is perfected in us.”

will come again and will take
you to myself, that where
I am you may be also.”

New Life, New Love
“For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from
whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
that according to the riches of his glory he may grant
you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in
your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts
through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in
love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints
what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge,
that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.”
Ephesians 3:14–19
When we’re spiritually reborn, Christ takes up residency in
our hearts and He becomes our source of strength and love, no
matter the circumstance. And that’s the key to living a godly,
obedient life on this otherwise withering, broken planet:
Love.
Indeed, love is the natural and right response of God’s
children to His loving intervention through Christ (i.e., Jesus
and “the good news that was preached to you”). But it isn’t just
our salvation that motivates and empowers us to love each other.
Rather, the command to “love one another earnestly” is grounded
in the eternality of our salvation. Because Christians have been
born into eternal life, we must live in sincere brotherly love for
one another in an eternal community of faith, one that reflects
(a) we are God’s children and God is love and (b) we are heavenbound where we’ll live together in the place He’s preparing for us.

LOVE

91

Keeping our eyes fixed on that forever home and family eases the heartbreak we
experience while waiting for eternity to commence—because we know our time here is short,
so any and all suffering is temporary and will be eclipsed by the joy that is to come. We know
that, in time, God is going to heal what’s broken and restore His creation. And we know that
Christ’s love, which dwells in our hearts through faith, is the very thing that will draw other
heartbroken people to Him.

Christ’s love is the balm for our grieving souls.
Your Turn
5. We typically think of love as a feeling that overcomes us and determines our actions.
But 1 John 4:7–12 describes love as a decision. What connections do you see between love and
obedience? How is loving obedience different from feelings that ebb and flow?

6. In what ways does having an eternal community of faith help to ease your present
heartbreak?

7. How will you obey the command to “love one another earnestly from a pure heart” today?

Following Orders
“We love because he first loved us. If anyone says, ‘I love God,’ and hates
his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has
seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment
we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother.
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God,
and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God
and obey his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep
his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.”
1 John 4:19–5:3
Loving one another is not a suggestion; it’s an order. But we follow orders because we
love the One who loved us first (Rom. 5:8). The One who guards and protects us (John
10:11–18). The One who keeps and leads us (Heb. 13:20–21). We obey His command to love
because we’re so fully and completely loved by Him already (Rom. 8:32). And when we share
His love, we’re participating in spreading the good news of the gospel because there’s simply
no better way to meet the needs of the moment we’re living in.
The world is indeed full of so much heartbreak, from which the followers of Jesus are not
always protected. But the balm of Christ’s presence, power, and love is healing and ultimately
eclipses the pain inflicted upon us by the broken world we live in.
The broken world we live in just for now.

the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he

MATTHEW: Mary, if you don’t—
MAGDALENE (firm): No, I want to know, I can handle it. Tell me.

Contaminants
In first-century Jewish culture, there was a ton of focus on things that contaminate. Mind
you, it wasn’t because the people were germophobes. Rather than notions of personal hygiene
for the protection of physical health, the people were concerned about “purity” because it
symbolized spiritual health. To that end, the Israelite priests were “to distinguish between the
holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,” in order “to teach the people of
Israel all the statutes that the LORD [had] spoken to them by Moses” (Lev. 10:10–11).
To that end, purity laws were far reaching and had implications for what food could be
consumed (Lev. 11), how to manage childbirth (Lev. 12), how to interact with sick people
(Lev. 13–14), how to treat bodily discharges (Lev. 15), and how to handle human corpses
(Num. 19). Of course, some forms of impurity were unavoidable in day-to-day life and
weren’t considered sinful in and of themselves (for example, when people died, their corpses
had to be handled in order to bury them). But the recognition of those things as forms of
impurity still demanded symbolic purification, which brought to the forefront the people’s
awareness of their need for a Savior (our permanent spiritual purification).

For Bible
Nerds
(like us)
Who Want
to Know
In the symbolism of ritual purity practices, of the various forms of contamination, the ultimate impurity was
death. In episode 7, when Jesus and
the group of His followers hear about
Lazarus’s death, Jesus announces that
they will go back to Judea where
their lives had just been threatened.
As the group is en route, John and

Thomas discuss death, and John asks
about Thomas’s earlier remark, “Let
us also go, that we may die with him”
(John 11:16). John tries to encourage
Thomas to recognize that death is not
an honorable goal in life. But Thomas
tries to help John recognize that death
is a fact of life: “We have been forced
to accept that death is a part of life.”
And certainly Thomas is correct:
death is a fact of life.
But that’s not the final word on
the topic. Elsewhere in the group,
Mary Magdalene and Little James
ponder Psalm 13 (see page 54).
Contemplating the biblical phrase
“lest I sleep the sleep of death,”

Little James notes that sometimes
the terms “sleep” and “death” are
used interchangeably. Then Mary
notes that perhaps it’s possible to
be “awakened” from death, which
is why she said, “We’ll sit shiva, or
we won’t,” because she understands
that Jesus is powerful enough to
cleanse a person from the ultimate
impurity symbol: death.
Indeed, that’s precisely what happens. Jesus “awakens” Lazarus from
the “sleep” of death. Of course,
we know from Scripture that not
long after, Jesus Himself rose from
the dead, proving once and for all
that He is our permanent spiritual
purification.

Fast-forward to what Peter said about purity in terms of obedience and love: “Having
purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one
another earnestly from a pure heart” (1 Pet. 1:22). After which, he provided a short list of
things that contaminate that love: “So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and
envy and all slander” (2:1). Such things derail the love believers share within the community
of faith, making them worse than the actual physical diseases people

tried to avoid because these evils threaten what new life in Jesus is supposed to be.
It’s supposed to be good.

Your Turn
1. Early followers of Christ understood the importance of belonging to a loving community
and “putting away” contaminants that threatened that community. Which of Peter’s examples
(malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, slander) do you find most difficult to put away? What are some
others you struggle with that Peter didn’t specifically mention here?

Disinfecting Light
“But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded
ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper
with God’s word, but by the open statement
of the truth we would commend ourselves to
everyone’s conscience in the sight of God.”
2 Corinthians 4:2

Commend:
to entrust someone
or something to.
In other words, “we entrust
ourselves to you in the
sight of God, our actions
transparent and in full view.”

102

God’s Goodness for the Chosen

Jesus came to save us from the contamination of sin; that’s 100 percent true. But He
also came to save us for new life in Him that offers a restored relationship with God the
Father and an ongoing community within His family of believers. Of course, without Jesus,
sin stands between us and God—an insurmountable blockade that casts a long shadow of
darkness and death. To that end, it keeps us isolated from our loving Father, as well as other
believers, because (among sin’s other contaminations in our lives) we work hard to hide the
things we don’t want anyone to see.

But God.
“But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ
died for us” (Rom. 5:8 NIV).
As followers of Jesus and because of God’s love, we step into “the light of the gospel
of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God” (2 Cor. 4:4). And that light disinfects
because the things that once contaminated our hearts along with our relationships are (a)
illuminated by the Holy Spirit through conviction of sin (John 16:7–11), (b) forgiven when
we confess (1 John 1:9–10), (c) resisted with the strength and self-control He provides
(2 Tim. 1:7), and (d) right-sized with accountability and support from our brothers and
sisters in the faith (Gal. 6:1–2).
We “commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God” because we’ve
been forgiven and made pure by Jesus. To that end, there’s nothing left to hide. We can
be transparent and honest and authentic with others about our victories as well as our
ongoing struggles because we’ve been forgiven and accepted by God into His community.
And because of that, it’s time to grow up.

Who Want
to Know
The Gospel of John records some
of Jesus’s emotion in the story of
Lazarus’s raising. He was “deeply
moved in his spirit and greatly troubled” (11:33); “Jesus wept” (v. 35);
He was “deeply moved again” (v. 38);

and in commanding the dead man to
rise, He “cried out with a loud voice”
(v. 43).
Jesus wasn’t merely grieving over
His friend’s death or that Lazarus’s
friends and relatives were grieving
too. To be sure, Jesus was expressing the emotion of sadness here, but
there’s more. The “deeply moved”
term used twice in the story is best
understood as Jesus being “outraged”; He was not merely sad, but
angry with what was happening.
Some scholars have suggested Jesus
was angry at sickness itself, along

with sin and death in the human
experience, and how those things
cause so much sorrow. Others have
suggested Jesus was angry that the
expressions of grief had risen to the
point of unbelief—that the people
were grieving as if there was no hope
of resurrection (see 1 Thess. 4:13),
that the people’s grief was betraying
a lack of faith.
Perhaps it was both. Perhaps Jesus
was outraged over the fact that sin
and sickness have led humanity to be
captive to death and He was angry at
the specific sin of disbelief in God’s
power to raise the dead.

“But I say, walk by the Spirit,
and you will not gratify the
desires of the flesh. For
the desires of the flesh are
against the Spirit, and the
desires of the Spirit are
against the flesh, for these
are opposed to each other,
to keep you from doing the
things you want to do. But if
you are led by the Spirit, you
are not under the law. Now
the works of the flesh are
evident: sexual immorality,
impurity, sensuality, idolatry,
sorcery, enmity, strife,
jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries,
dissensions, divisions, envy,
drunkenness, orgies, and
things like these. I warn you,
as I warned you before, that
those who do such things
will not inherit the kingdom
of God. But the fruit of the
Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness, gentleness, selfcontrol; against such things
there is no law. And those
who belong to Christ Jesus
have crucified the flesh with
its passions and desires.”
Galatians 5:16–24

Taste and See
“Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed
is the one who takes refuge in him.”
Psalm 34:8 (NIV)
Believing God and what He says about sin means we
renounce what He deems disgraceful and underhanded. It
also means we embrace our lives in Christ along with the
things He says are good—things like authenticity within our
God-given communities and the “fruit” He’s producing inside
our hearts.
To that end, Peter encouraged his readers to grow in faith
by becoming like babies. Of course, he wasn’t intending for
Christians to be childish but instead to be childlike. Or, more
precisely, to be like children who want to grow. “Like newborn
infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may
grow up into salvation” (1 Pet. 2:2). And the life-giving, lifesustaining Word of God is the source of that pure spiritual
milk. Indeed, reading, hearing, and studying the Bible enable
our growth in the faith.
Mind you, spiritual growth refers to direction, not

perfection. Because even when we agree with God about our sin, it remains a potential
struggle on this side of eternity. As Paul said:
For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.
For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep

on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no
longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.
So I find it to be a law that when I want to do
right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law
of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members
another law waging war against the law of my mind
and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells
in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will
deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to
God through Jesus Christ our Lord! (Rom. 7:18–25)
Like Peter (and Paul, who wrote the NT book of Romans), we
must repeatedly choose to put contaminants away. We must remain
honest with ourselves and those we trust that we’re still prone to sin.
And we must embrace spiritual goodness and growth because

of the Lord’s goodness to us. In fact, the faithful apostle
instructed his readers to long for growth since “you have tasted that
the Lord is good” (1 Pet. 2:3).

Experiencing goodness from the Lord—His grace, forgiveness,
healing power, and unwavering love (just to name a few)—encourages
us to look to His Word in order to hear more from Him. To dedicate
time in prayer in order to be led more by Him. To lean into our
relationship with Him as well as those He’s placed in our lives in
order to be more obedient to Him. And as a result of that obedience,
we taste and see His goodness again and again in our lives.
And who doesn’t want more of what’s good?

Nerds

Peter further described
brotherly
love
(which
includes sisterly love ) in
1 Peter 3:8–12, where he
quoted Psalm 34:12–16
about seeing good days as
a result of obedient living:
“Finally, all of you, have
unity of mind, sympathy,
brotherly love, a tender
heart, and a humble mind.
Do not repay evil for evil or
reviling for reviling, but on
the contrary, bless, for to
this you were called, that
you may obtain a blessing. For ‘whoever desires
to love life and see good
days, let him keep his
tongue from evil and his
lips from speaking deceit;
let him turn away from
evil and do good; let him
seek peace and pursue it.
For the eyes of the Lord
are on the righteous, and
his ears are open to their
prayer. But the face of the
Lord is against those who
do evil.’”

5. What good things have you experienced from the Lord?

6. Paul’s response to his sin in Romans 7:24–25 was twofold:
a. He recognized his propensity for sin: “Wretched man that I am! Who will
deliver me from this body of death?”
b. He praised God for saving him from sin: “Thanks be to God through Jesus
Christ our Lord!”
In what ways do those statements encourage you to remain dedicated to growing in faith
and in your relationship with Jesus?

For Bible
Nerds
(like us)
Who Want
to Know
The familiar story of Lazarus recorded
in chapter 11 of the Gospel of John
mentions that each of his sisters—
Martha and Mary (a popular name

in that day!)—said to Jesus, “Lord,
if you had been here, my brother
would not have died” (vv. 21, 32).
It seems that, while both of them
had faith that Jesus could heal the
sick, neither of them were ready for
a raising from the dead. To be sure,
Martha believed in a future, endtimes resurrection. When Jesus said,
“Your brother will rise again,” she
professed, “I know that he will rise
again in the resurrection on the last
day” (vv. 23–24).

Jesus confirmed her expression of
faith: “I am the resurrection and the
life. Whoever believes in me, though
he die, yet shall he live, and everyone
who lives and believes in me shall
never die” (vv. 25–26).
But He was intending to give an
advanced taste of that resurrection
power by raising Lazarus from the
dead that very day! Which means
their suffering was eclipsed by the
good thing—the far better thing—
God was doing in and through it.

7. What changes can you make today in order to grow more, in order to experience more,
of God’s goodness?

Dedication
“I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present
your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which
is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be
transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern
what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.”
Romans 12:1–2
This world is full of brokenness, hardship, trials, pain, and even death. But it’s also full of
God’s goodness because His presence, power, and plans for each one of us remain firmly in
place. He works in and through our suffering to cleanse us of contaminants and grow our faith,
along with our capacity to endure trials. He teaches our hearts to hope in heaven and to praise
Him while we wait for it to commence. He is wholly dedicated to caring for those of us who
follow Jesus—which is why we should wholly dedicate ourselves right back to Him. Indeed, all
the things we do, all the words we say, and every moment we spend this side of heaven should be
done “in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him” (Col. 3:17).
Why?
Because He’s good! And because we want more of His goodness. And because we believe
Him when He tells us that dedicated obedience to Him is the way we’ll experience more of

108

God’s Goodness for the Chosen

that goodness. And because through trials and, yes, suffering, we’ve come to understand that
His will and ways are good, acceptable, and perfect.
Just like He said.
“I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will
have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).

Your Turn
8. In what ways have sin or suffering in your life been eclipsed by obedience to the Lord
and by His goodness that flows through it?

Prayer Focus
Praise Jesus for being your
permanent spiritual purification. Thank Him for your
community of believers, and
for the opportunity to love
others the way God has loved
you. Ask for courage and
strength to obey more and
more, and for opportunities
to taste and see that obedience is
worth the sacrifice it requires.

Sample Prayer
O LORD, I call upon you; hasten
to me! Give ear to my voice when I call to
you! Let my prayer be counted as incense before
you, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening
sacrifice! Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep
watch over the door of my lips! Do not let my heart incline
to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with
men who work iniquity, and let me not eat of their delicacies!
Let a righteous man strike me—it is a kindness; let him rebuke
me—it is oil for my head; let my head not refuse it. Yet my prayer
is continually against their evil deeds. When their judges are
thrown over the cliff, then they shall hear my words, for they are
pleasant. As when one plows and breaks up the earth, so shall
our bones be scattered at the mouth of Sheol. But my eyes
are toward you, O GOD, my Lord; in you I seek refuge;
leave me not defenseless! Keep me from the trap
that they have laid for me and from the snares
of evildoers! Let the wicked fall into their
own nets, while I pass by safely.

As this Bible study and our own life stories have revealed,
following Jesus doesn’t lead to earthly comfort and happiness.
On the contrary, our leader voluntarily walked to the cross,
giving up His own life to save ours. He entrusted Himself
to the Father and willingly received all that came with His
submission. He, in fact, embraced the pain because He knew
what was coming on the other side.
Our redemption. Our freedom. Our forever with Him in
heaven.
Yet, so often we assume God’s favor will result in the
lessening of (or all-out prevention of) pain. We think being
chosen ensures our earthly lives will turn out well. We think
being part of the kingdom of God will allow us to sidestep
worldly wrongs like injustice, brokenness, sadness, sickness,
loneliness … even though Jesus experienced every one of those
things to the greatest possible degree.
Peter called Him the “living stone rejected by men.” But
he also called Him the “cornerstone chosen and precious”
and declared that “whoever believes in him will not be put to
shame.”

“For this reason the Father
loves me, because I lay down
my life that I may take it
up again. No one takes it
from me, but I lay it down
of my own accord. I have
authority to lay it down, and
I have authority to take it
up again. This charge I have
received from my Father.”
John 10:17–18

“For to this you have been
called, because Christ also
suffered for you, leaving
you an example, so that
you might follow in his
steps. He committed no sin,
neither was deceit found
in his mouth. When he was
reviled, he did not revile in
return; when he suffered,
he did not threaten, but
continued entrusting himself
to him who judges justly. He
himself bore our sins in his
body on the tree, that we
might die to sin and live to
righteousness. By his wounds
you have been healed.
For you were straying
like sheep, but have now
returned to the Shepherd
and Overseer of your souls.”
1 Peter 2:21–25

You will not be put to shame.
You will not be put to shame.
You will not be put to shame.

“But he was pierced
for our transgressions;
he was crushed for our
iniquities; upon him was the
chastisement that brought
us peace, and with his
wounds we are healed.”
Isaiah 53:5

118
“And he began to teach them
that the Son of Man must suffer
many things and be rejected by
the elders and the chief priests
and the scribes and be killed, and
after three days rise again.”
Mark 8:31

“Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged
him. And the soldiers twisted
together a crown of thorns and put
it on his head and arrayed him in a
purple robe. They came up to him,
saying, ‘Hail, King of the Jews!’ and
struck him with their hands. Pilate
went out again and said to them,
‘See, I am bringing him out to you
that you may know that I find no
guilt in him.’ So Jesus came out,
wearing the crown of thorns and
the purple robe. Pilate said to them,
‘Behold the man!’ When the chief
priests and the officers saw him, they
cried out, ‘Crucify him, crucify him!’”
John 19:1–6
Roman flogging:
whipping with leather strips that had
small pieces of metal or bone at the
ends intended for tearing flesh.
Crucify:
capital punishment wherein
the victim was nailed to a cross
or large wooden beam and
hung until eventual death.

“In the days of his flesh, Jesus
offered up prayers and supplications,
with loud cries and tears, to him
who was able to save him from
death, and he was heard because
of his reverence. Although he
was a son, he learned obedience
through what he suffered.”
Hebrews 5:7–8

Your Turn
1. Spend some time contemplating all the ways
Jesus suffered while living on earth, along with the
verses in the margin. What strikes you most about the
hardship He faced?

Vindicated
If you follow Jesus, you’re like a living
stone being built into a dwelling place
of worship:
“So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but
you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of
the household of God, built on the foundation of the
apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the
cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined
together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. In him
you also are being built together into a dwelling place for
God by the Spirit” (Eph. 2:19–22).

If you follow Jesus, you’re heaven-bound
where pain and suffering will be no more:
“And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
‘Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will
dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God

shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former
things have passed away’” (Rev. 21:3–4).

If you follow Jesus, your faith in Him will soon become sight:
“For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial
will pass away. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like
a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly,
but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully
known” (1 Cor. 13:9–12).

If you obey Jesus, your faithfulness will be rewarded:
“Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil
against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for
so they persecuted the prophets who were before you” (Matt. 5:11–12).

Who Want
to Know
Perhaps it should be no surprise
that Peter—whose name means
“rock”—has a section in his letter
about stones! He referred to Jesus
as “a living stone rejected by men
but in the sight of God chosen and
precious” (1 Pet. 2:4) and to believ-

ers who “like living stones are being
built up as a spiritual house” (v. 5).
Meaning, the personal devotion of
individual believers to Jesus results
in a community that is being built up
together into a place of worship.

cious cornerstone, of a sure foundation: ‘Whoever believes will not be in
haste.’”

Growing Christians grow together.

Peter then paraphrased that verse and
identified Jesus as God’s salvation,
and reiterated that those who believe
would not be put to shame.

In 1 Peter 2:4–8, the apostle cited
several Old Testament passages that
also utilize a building metaphor and
the use of stones. In Isaiah 28:16,
God announced His forthcoming
work of salvation: “Behold, I am the
one who has laid as a foundation in
Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a pre-

But while Isaiah 28 references the
good news about those who believe
in Jesus as the cornerstone, Peter
went on to cite Psalm 118:22 and
the bad news for those who do
not believe: “The stone that the
builders rejected has become the
cornerstone.”

If you surrender to Jesus, you will forevermore be part of His
kingdom, which will not fail. Or fall. Or end:
“And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name
Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will
give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever,
and of his kingdom there will be no end” (Luke 1:31–33).

And someday soon, this broken world will be fully and completely
eclipsed by the new one Jesus promises to bring with Him when
He returns:
“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had
passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming
down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.… And he who
was seated on the throne said, ‘Behold, I am making all things new.’ Also he said, ‘Write
this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.’ And he said to me, ‘It is done! I am
the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the
spring of the water of life without payment. The one who conquers will have this heritage,
and I will be his God and he will be my son.’ … Then the angel showed me the river of the
water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through
the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with
its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the
healing of the nations. No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God
and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. They will see his face, and
his name will be on their foreheads. And night will be no more. They will need no light
of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever”
(Rev. 21:1–2, 5–7; 22:1–5).

Christ” (1 Pet. 1:6–7).

All the Things
“And we know that for those who love God
all things work together for good,
for those who are called according to his purpose.”
Romans 8:28

Disillusioned:
to be disappointed in
someone or something
that is discovered to be
less “good” than what
we thought it would be.

Our human tendency is to resist suffering. To see it as a bad
thing. To blame God for it, or to become disillusioned by the
things He allows in our lives. To writhe in frustration. To fixate
on what we don’t have. To grieve without hope. To pull away from
the One who wants to comfort us, help us, heal us, change us.

But when it comes to hardship, perhaps we’ve been responding all wrong.
Jesus didn’t resist the cross. Or, for that matter, any of the trials He endured before it:
“He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that
we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and
familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held
him in low esteem. Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him
punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions,
he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by
his wounds we are healed” (Isa. 53:2–5 NIV).
Indeed, Christ willingly submitted Himself to God’s plan for mankind’s salvation,
knowing that all of it would be used for our good and His glory—because God is faithful
and can’t be anything but good and loving and purposeful and sovereign and present and
perfect in knowledge and wholly committed to our sanctification.
And He loves you.
And He sees you.
And He’s for you.
And He’s got you in the palm of His hand and at the center of His will.

Oh that we’d believe all of it and rest in God’s wisdom, surrender to His will, and receive
what He has for us, both now and forevermore.

Who Want
to Know
Unlike modern English writers,
ancient authors like Peter had no
qualms about mixing their metaphors.
In Peter’s letter, he went from eating
metaphors (spiritual food and tasting)
to a building metaphor (stones for
constructing). Meaning, those who
follow Jesus are like living stones who
are being built into a spiritual house of

worship, Christ being the cornerstone
of that building. Of course, in ancient
construction, the cornerstone was the
most necessary and vital point in a
structure’s foundation for measuring,
leveling, erecting, and ensuring the
rest of the building.
Thus, Jesus is the cornerstone upon
which the entire house of God is
being joined together.
He’s also the Lamb. In Matthew 25:3146, Jesus said that those who follow
Him are like sheep, and He explained
how He’ll separate those who truly
believed (“the sheep”) from those
who merely claimed to believe but
were not transformed (“the goats”).

He’s also living water.
“Whoever drinks of the water that
I will give him will never be thirsty
again. The water that I will give him
will become in him a spring of water
welling up to eternal life” (John 4:14).
He’s also the bread of life.
“I am the bread of life; whoever
comes to me shall not hunger, and
whoever believes in me shall never
thirst” (John 6:35).
He’s also the light of the world.
Jesus said, “I am the light of the
world. Whoever follows me will not
walk in darkness, but will have the
light of life” (John 8:12).

7. How might you begin to surrender to and receive all that God has for you?

Receive
“Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of
witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin
that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the
race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and
perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the
cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the
throne of God. Consider him who endured such opposition
from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.”
Hebrews 12:1–3 (NIV)
When suffering is put in the light of everything God has promised, and everything
He’s faithfully doing, the hard things we experience on earth lose some of their vigor and
significance, don’t they? That’s not to say our pain isn’t real. It is. In fact, no one understands
that more than Jesus, “the pioneer and perfector of our faith.”
But since this world is passing away like a vapor (James 4:14), and because God is

good and all His plans are for the good of those who love Him (Ps.
84:11), we can resolve to receive all He has for us while we’re here. As we do, we can trust
Him to go before, behind, and beside us (Deut. 31:8; Ps. 139:1–3); to provide peace and
wisdom beyond our usual capacity or understanding (Phil. 4:6–7; James 1:5); to continue
loving us beyond our comprehension and in all the fullness for which we were created
(Eph. 3:18–19).

Like our beloved Savior—and for the joy set before us—we can endure. As we do, we can

He is our joy.

They stumble because they
disobey the word, as they
were destined to do.”
1 Peter 2:7–8

“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
a holy nation, a people for his own possession,
that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who
called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.

Once you were not a people, but now you are
God’s people; once you had not received mercy,
but now you have received mercy.”
1 Peter 2:9–10

CONCLUSION
Peter concluded the first section of his letter to “the elect exiles of the Dispersion” (1 Pet.
1:1) with a statement about their very identity.
And ours.
We are chosen.
We are set apart.
We are cherished.
We are recipients of God’s mercy.
We are heralds of His goodness.
We are citizens of heaven.
Like Peter, we can rejoice in trials, in hardship, and yes, even in suffering because we
understand their purpose in our lives, which is why we fix our eyes on the blessings therein
and hold fast to how radically good God is, while we wait on the bigger thing He’s doing.
Indeed, the hard things we experience in this short life are always eclipsed by the bigger
thing God is doing in and through them. So, instead of lamenting our lack, we welcome it.
“Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as
though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you share Christ’s
sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed” (1 Pet. 4:12–13).
Oh that we would trust God with greater anticipation—and even joy—that His perfect,
loving, and unfailing plan for our lives is good. Oh that we would embrace our identity
in Christ and stand firm in the victory He’s already secured. And oh that we, like all the
faithful followers of Jesus who came before us, would proclaim the good news of His merciful
salvation all the way to heaven.
It is, after all, only a matter of time.
